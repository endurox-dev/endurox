To perform Oracle DB tests, needs following configuration:

1) Configure settings in setenv

2) Load the settings with $ source setenv

3) Create database user

4) Configure settings in sqlplus.run. When SQLPLUS is running, execute:

SQL> @tables.sql

5) Configure database settings in run.sh, NDRX_XA_*. Note that demo data is filled with: SID=ROCKY user=endurotest pass=endurotest1

6) run off ./run.sh


To build the all this, firstly -DENABLE_TEST47=ON must be added to cmake configuration. But before build you have to run 1) and 2).
otherwise build will not see "proc" PRO*C precompiler.
