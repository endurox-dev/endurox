# So plan is following:
# 1. we start auto deadly process with xadmin start -y
# 2. we kill deadly process  & wait for background ndrxd will respawn it.
# 3. we start manually good process inbackground - now it cannot compelete the init, because bad process have semaphore
# 4. we test that OK service is not advertised
# 5. we kill the bad service, system releases sempahore, good process gets advertised & we test that
# .... this is the test ....
