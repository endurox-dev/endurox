List of test cases

01 - Simple cache, perform one call, get tstamp. Perform another call, the 
timestamp shall be the same. Perform another call, to get second record in cache. 
Use xadmin cs and xadmin cd to dup the results. Before test db shall be cleaned 
up with xadmin ci <dbname>.


02 - Test service dissappear after server shutdown. After bootup have cached results
as "clrnosvc" was not specified for db. Two db setup.

03 - Test "clrnosvc", the cached results after boot shall dissappear.

04 - timed cache with expiry. Use different service cache and different database. 
Use flag to drop the db at startup, by ndrxd. Record shall be limited to 10seconds. 
Add few recs, check they exist in cache with `cs'. wait 10 sec, 
they should be removed from cache. DB set expiry=10s

05 - refresh local cache by special key. tpcache config refreshrule=<some expr>

06 - boot cache reset tests, TODO: try to reboot the only tpcachebt server, no
changes shall be made to cache

07 - negative response caching tests (rsprule)

08 - invalidate their (two add services, inval 1, inval 2, cache result)

09 - limited cache, LRU tests

10 - limited cache, HITS tests, if running on linux, try /dev/shm as storage
folder

11 - limited cache, fifo tests

12 - limited cache, HITS + expiry
