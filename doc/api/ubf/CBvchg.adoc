NAME
----
CBvchg - Convert from user type and change field value in VIEW field


SYNOPSIS
--------

#include <ubf.h>

int CBvchg(char *'cstruct', char *'view', char *'cname', BFLDOCC 'occ', 
             char *'buf', BFLDLEN 'len', int 'usrtype');

Link with '-lubf -lnstd -lm -lpthread'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Function is used to set field data dynamically to VIEW buffer field. 'cstruct' is pointer 
to C structure instance (object), 'view' is name of the VIEW (must match the instance of the
object), 'occ' is field array occurrence, if field is not an array or first array element must
be set, then use occ=0. 'buf' is buffer where to take user data from. 'len' is  used for 
indicating the length of the bytes of the target buffer ('buf') size in bytes. 
If field size in VIEW is shorter than data putting to, then *BNOSPACE* error is returned.
'len' is used only for *BFLD_CARRAY* fields.
'usrtype' is user type indicating the data type of the 'buf', 
if types are different, the automatic data conversion is performed. And VIEW matched data
is installed in the cstruct field offset. If current array C_ (count) field is less than
occurrences, then C_ count field is adjusted accordingly to have the occurrence included in
the count range.

RETURN VALUE
------------
On success, *CBvchg()* return zero; on error, -1 is returned, with *Berror* set to 
indicate the error.

ERRORS
------
Note that *Bstrerror()* returns generic error message plus custom message with debug info 
from last function call, stored in thread local storage (TLS).

*BEINVAL* 'view', 'cstruct' or 'buf' is NULL. 'view' or 'cname' is empty string (first byte
0x00). Or occurrence is out of bounds of the array declaration.

*BBADVIEW* invalid view name (not found in view file).

*BNOCNAME* field name ('cname') not found in view structure.

*BNOSPACE* No space in view field to install data (data larger than field size).

*BMALLOC* Failed to allocate type conversion buffer.
