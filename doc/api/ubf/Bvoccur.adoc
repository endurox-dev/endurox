DESCRIPTION
-----------
Return the occurrences set in buffer. This will either return 'C' (C_<field>) 
count field value, or will return max array size. 'cstruct' is view structure
instance (object). 'view' is view name of which 'cstruct' is instance of. 'maxocc'
is number of maximum possible occurrences for view field (this is basically number
defined in 'COUNT' column in view file). 'maxocc' is optional and can be NULL.
'realocc' is number of filled occurrences in array tested from the C_<field> 
indicator position or from the end of the array. The 'realocc' will return 
number of occurrences as number to which corresponds first non NULL element 
when testing from the end of the array. 'realocc' is optional and can be NULL.
'dim_size' returns the number bytes takes one view field element (or field it self
if count is set to 1 in view file). 'fldtype' is view field type, see 'BLFD_*'
constants.


RETURN VALUE
------------
On success, *Bvoccur()* returns number of field occurrences (max or set in count); 
on error, *-1* is returned, with *Berror* set to indicate the error.
