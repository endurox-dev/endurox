NAME
----
Bvftos - Transfer data from UBF buffer to view (C structure)


SYNOPSIS
--------

#include <ubf.h>

int Bvftos(UBFH *'p_ub', char *'cstruct', char *'view');

Link with '-lubf -lnstd -lm -lpthread'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This function is used to transfer the data from UBF buffer 'p_ub' to VIEW structure 'cstruct'. 
The view name is passed by 'view' argument. The name present by 'view' must be
present in view object files. Configured by *VIEWDIR* and *VIEWFILES* environment
variables.
The view file (see *viewfile(5)* page), shall contain the mappings in 'UBF_NAME' column.
If mapping is present (not "-"), the function will perform data transfer from corresponding
UBF buffer to mapped C view field. The transfer is performed only in case if in
column 'FLAGS' of view file the flag *S* is present, and flag *N* is not present.
If UBF buffer have more occurrences that defined in 'COUNT' column of view file,
then extra UBF occurrences are ignored. If occurrences are less than 'COUNT' specified
in view, then those missing array elements are filled with 'NULL_VAL' value. If
flag *C* is present, then count field will be initialized to number of elements
transferred to structure. If *L* flag was present, then for *string* and *carray*
elements, the number of bytes transferred to each array element is set.

RETURN VALUE
------------
On success, *Bvftos()* return zero; on error, -1 is returned, with *Berror* set to 
indicate the error.

ERRORS
------
Note that *Bstrerror()* returns generic error message plus custom message with 
debug info from last function call.

*BALIGNERR* Corrupted buffer or pointing to not aligned memory area.

*BNOTFLD* Buffer not fielded, not correctly allocated or corrupted.

*BBADFLD* Invalid field id passed.

*BBADVIEW* View is not found, object file is defective or system error.

*BVFSYNTAX* Defective object file.
