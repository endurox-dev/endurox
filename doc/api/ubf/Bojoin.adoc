NAME
----
Bojoin - outer join source buffer into destination buffer


SYNOPSIS
--------

#include <ubf.h>

int Bojoin(UBFH *'dest', UBFH *'src');

Link with '-lubf -lnstd -lm -lpthread'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Bojoin function is similar to Bjoin function.
Outer join function updates destination buffer in 'dest' with source buffer 'src' 
values based on matching fields and occurrence. Function will update existing 
fields from source buffer to destination with matching occurrences. If field 
does not exist or occurrence does not exists, then field/occurrence is not removed 
from destination buffer. By comparing to *Bupdate(3)*, this function updates only
matched fields, and does not add any missing as it is done by *Bupdate(3)*. By
comparing to *Bjoin(3)*, *Bjoin(3)* will remove not matched fields from 'dest',
but *Bojoin()* will leave dest fields non deleted.


RETURN VALUE
------------
On success, *Bojoin()* return zero; on error, -1 is returned, with *Berror* set 
to indicate the error.


ERRORS
------
Bstrerror(3) can give more description for error (for last call).

*BALIGNERR* Corrupted buffer or pointing to not aligned memory area.

*BNOTFLD* Buffer not fielded, not correctly allocated or corrupted. 
dest or src is NULL.

*FBADFLD* Invalid field type.
