NAME
----
Breadcb - Read the UBF buffer from Bwritecb(3) serialized format


SYNOPSIS
--------

#include <ubf.h>

int Breadcb (UBFH * p_ub, long (*p_readf)(char *buffer, long bufsz, void *dataptr1), void *dataptr1);

Link with '-lubf -lnstd -lm -lpthread'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*Breadcb()* is a function which reads UBF/'p_ub' buffer from the callback function.
specified in 'p_readf' argument. The arguments to callback are 'buffer' which
is data buffer into which data must be read. The number of bytes required by
particular request are specified in 'bufsz'. This is precise number of bytes
that are required to be read from the data source. Basically two read requests
are performed by the function. The first reads the header and the scond extracts
from the header buffer length and remaining bytes are read. The 'dataptr1' argument
to callback are forwarded from main function arguments. This is usable for cases
when some other control objects must be passed to callback. The callback must
return number of bytes read from the source. For success case parameter
'bufsz' must be return from the callback (i.e. read bytes matches),
otherwise *Breadcb()* will fail.
In case of failure inside the callback, return value *-1*.

RETURN VALUE
------------
On success, *Breadcb()* return zero; on error, -1 is returned, 
with *Berror* set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
------
Note that *Bstrerror()* returns generic error message plus custom message with 
debug info from last function call.

*BALIGNERR* Corrupted buffer or pointing to not aligned memory area.

*BNOTFLD* Buffer not fielded, not correctly allocated or corrupted.

*BEINVAL* 'readf' is NULL.

*BEUNIX* Failed to read from stream.

EXAMPLE
-------
See *ubftest/test_readwrite.c* for sample code.
