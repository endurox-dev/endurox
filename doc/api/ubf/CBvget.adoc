NAME
----
CBvget - Get and convert to user type data from UBF buffer


SYNOPSIS
--------

#include <ubf.h>

int CBvget(char *'cstruct', char *'view', char *'cname', BFLDOCC 'occ', char *'buf', 
BFLDLEN *'len', int 'usrtype', long 'flags');

Link with '-lubf -lnstd -lm -lpthread'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Function is used to get field data dynamically from VIEW buffer. 'cstruct' is pointer 
to C structure instance (object), 'view' is name of the VIEW (must match the instance of the
object), 'occ' is field array occurrence, if field is not an array or first array element must
be read, then use occ=0. 'buf' is buffer where to output the data. 'len' is used on both
directions, on *input* it is used for indicating the length of the bytes for the target buffer 
('buf'). If the data is larger than 'len' indicated, then error *BNOSPACE* is returned. 
Then 'len' is optional. If set to NULL, then no such checks are made, and it is assumed 
that buffer lenght is sufficiend to store the data. 'len' is used only for *BFLD_STRING* 
and *BFLD_CARRAY* fields. On output 'len' (if not NULL), indicates the length of data loaded in 'buf'. 
Indicated in bytes. 'usrtype' is user type indicating the data type of the 'buf', 
if types are different, the automatic data conversion is performed. 'flags' is either set to
0 in which case data is returned as is in the VIEW, does not matter if it matches the *NULL*
value specified in VIEW file or not, the exact value is returned. If flag *BVACCESS_NOTNULL*
is specified, then if value in field matches *NULL* column in view file, then error 
*BNOTPRES* is returned. *BNOTPRES* can be returned in case if 'C' flag was set in view file,
and the count indicator is set to less than occurrence specified.


RETURN VALUE
------------
On success, *CBvget()* return zero; on error, -1 is returned, with *Berror* set to 
indicate the error.

ERRORS
------
Note that *Bstrerror()* returns generic error message plus custom message with debug info 
from last function call, stored in thread local storage (TLS).

*BEINVAL* 'view', 'cstruct' or 'buf' is NULL. 'view' or 'cname' is empty string (first byte
0x00). Or occurrence is out of bounds of the array declaration.

*BBADVIEW* invalid view name (not found in view file).

*BNOCNAME* field name ('cname') not found in view structure.

*BNOSPACE* No space in 'buf'.

*BMALLOC* Failed to allocate type conversion buffer.

*BNOTPRES* Field not present (in case field value matches NULL in view file and *BVACCESS_NOTNULL*
is set or count (C_) field is less than occurrence requested.
