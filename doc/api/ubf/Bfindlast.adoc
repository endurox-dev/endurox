NAME
----
Bfindlast - find the last value and occurrence of the field in UBF buffer


SYNOPSIS
--------

#include <ubf.h>

char * Bfindlast (UBFH *'p_ub', BFLDID 'bfldid', BFLDOCC *'occ', BFLDLEN *'len');

Link with '-lubf -lnstd -lm -lpthread'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Function on success returns pointer to data field present in UBF buffer. 'p_ub' is pointer to UBF buffer, 'bfldid' is field id, 'occ' is field occurrence at which last field was found. 'occ' can be NULL, in that case the occurrence value is not returned. 'p_len' is output paramter for indicating the type length in bytes. Then 'len' is optional. Note that pointer to field is valid only that time while the buffer is not changed. If changes occurr, then returned pointer might become invalid (point wrong data area).

Difference between *Bfind(3)* is that this function returns the last occurrence in 'occ' variable instead of consuming the 'occ' to return exact field.

RETURN VALUE
------------
On success, *Bfindlast()* return zero; on error, -1 is returned, with *Berror* set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
------
Note that *Bstrerror()* returns generic error message plus custom message with debug info from last function call.

*BALIGNERR* Corrupted buffer or pointing to not aligned memory area.

*BNOTFLD* Buffer not fielded, not correctly allocated or corrupted.

*BNOTPRES* Field not present.

*BBADFLD* Invalid field id passed in.

EXAMPLE
-------
See *ubftest/test_find.c* for sample code.
