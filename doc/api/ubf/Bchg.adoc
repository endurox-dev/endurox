NAME
----
Bchg - Change (add or update) field occurrance in UBF buffer


SYNOPSIS
--------

#include <ubf.h>

int Bchg (UBFH *'p_ub', BFLDID 'bfldid', BFLDOCC 'occ', char *'buf', BFLDLEN 'len');

Link with '-lubf -lnstd -lm -lpthread'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Change (add or update) field in UBF buffer. The UBF buffer pointer is passed by 
'p_ub', field id in 'bfldid'. 'occ' is occurrance to change. The field value is 
passed in 'buf'. The 'len' is used only if 'bfldid' type is *BFLD_CARRAY*, for 
which length cannot be detected from passed data. The 'buf' field type must 
match the 'bfldid' field type.

If 'occ' is bigger than last existing index+1 in buffer then non existing 
occurrences (which are not being set directly by this function) are initialized 
with defaults. For numerics it is 0, for *BFLD_CHAR* it is 0x00, for *BFLD_STRING* 
it is empty string, for *BFLD_CARRAY* it is empty byte array (with length 0).

For performance reasons, it is recommended to use Bchg over CBchg,
to skip the conversion step.

RETURN VALUE
------------
On success, *Bchg()* return zero; on error, -1 is returned, with *Berror* set to
 indicate the error.

ERRORS
------
Note that *Bstrerror()* returns generic error message plus custom message with 
debug info from last function call.

*BALIGNERR* Corrupted buffer or pointing to not aligned memory area.

*BNOTFLD* Buffer not fielded, not correctly allocated or corrupted.

*BNOSPACE* No space in buffer for string data.

*BBADFLD* Invalid field id passed.

EXAMPLE
-------
See *ubftest/ubfunit1.c* for sample code.
