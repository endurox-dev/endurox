DESCRIPTION
-----------
Function compares two views by analyzing the view type and their contents. Compare
is based on following principles:

. The names are compared as strings and if they differ, result is returned.

. The count indicators (if used) are matched. If differ, result is returned.

. Only used fields are compared. Array values beyond count indicator (if used) are ignored.

. For *CARRAY* if length indicator is used, then it is matched in first place, 
if differ, result is returned.

All function arguments must not be *NULL*. In case of error (for example view
is not defined), value *-2* is returned.

RETURN VALUE
------------
On success, *Bvcmp()* return *-1* if 'view1'/'cstruct1' is lesser than 'view2'/'cstruct2'.
*0* is returned in case of both structures matches. *1* is returned in case if 
'view1'/'cstruct1' is lesser greater than 'view2'/'cstruct2'.

ERRORS
------
Note that *Bstrerror()* returns generic error message plus custom message with debug info 
from last function call.

*BEINVAL* 'cstruct1', 'view1', 'cstruct2' or 'view2' is *NULL*.

*BBADVIEW* 'view' not found in view files.
