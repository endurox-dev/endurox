NAME
----
Bwritecb - Write the UBF buffer to callback function


SYNOPSIS
--------

#include <ubf.h>

int Bwritecb (UBFH *p_ub, 
        long (*p_writef)(char *buffer, long bufsz, void *dataptr1), void *dataptr1);

Link with '-lubf -lnstd -lm -lpthread'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Transfer UBF buffer presented by 'p_ub' to callback function set by 'p_writef'.
The callback function accepts 'buffer' which contains UBF buffer, the 'bufsz'
contains the number of bytes in buffer. The 'dataptr1' from main function is
forwarded to callback, so that customer user pointer can be passed to callback.
The callback must return number of bytes written, which for case of success
must be equal to the 'bufsz' passed to callback function. Otherwise error will
be generated. In case if callback fails, -1 shall be returned to callback
function. Currently the whole buffer is present in single write callback, but
this subject of change in future.

RETURN VALUE
------------
On success, *Bwrite()* return zero; on error, -1 is returned, 
with *Berror* set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
------
Note that *Bstrerror()* returns generic error message plus custom message 
with debug info from last function call.

*BALIGNERR* Corrupted buffer or pointing to not aligned memory area.

*BNOTFLD* Buffer not fielded, not correctly allocated or corrupted.

*BEINVAL* 'outf' is NULL.

*BEUNIX* Failed to read from stream.

*BNOSPACE* No space in 'p_ub'.

EXAMPLE
-------
See *ubftest/test_readwrite.c* for sample code.
