NAME
----
Baddfast - Fast adding to buffer


SYNOPSIS
--------

#include <ubf.h>

int Baddfast (UBFH *p_ub, BFLDID bfldid, char *buf, BFLDLEN len, Bfld_loc_info_t *next_fld);

Link with '-lubf -lnstd -lm -lpthread'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
dd field to UBF buffer. By difference to Badd, this function offers to add next
occurrence of the field just right after the previous Baddfast function. So basically
if batch of occurrences needs to be loaded to buffer or incrementing BFLDID of the
same type needs to be added to the buffer in quick manner, then at first call
provide 'next_fld' set to 0 (memset('next_fld', 0, sizeof('next_fld'))). Then first
call will add data as normal *Badd()* call, but in result 'next_fld' will keep
the pointer to last position of the buffer, just right after data inserted. Thus
Next Baddfast() is performing from that place. The benefit is avoided position search
in buffer, which at large number of occurrences might grow exponentially. Then
'p_ub' buffer must not be modified between the calls. 'next_fld' is valid only
for adding the same field occurrences or adding (when programmer knows for sure), 
incremented field id. In that case search can be avoided too. That can be beneficial
in case if adding carrays or strings, as on the UBF does not do binary search.

The UBF buffer pointer is passed by 'p_ub', field id in 'bfldid'. 
The user value is passed in 'buf'. The 'len' is used only if filed type is 
*BFLD_CARRAY*, for which length cannot be detected from passed data. 
The data type for 'buf' must batch with 'bfldid' type.

RETURN VALUE
------------
On success, *Baddfast()* return zero; on error, -1 is returned, 
with *Berror* set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
------
Note that *Bstrerror()* returns generic error message plus custom message with debug info from last function call.

*BEINVAL* 'next_fld' is NULL

*BALIGNERR* Corrupted buffer or pointing to not aligned memory area.

*BNOTFLD* Buffer not fielded, not correctly allocated or corrupted.

*BNOSPACE* No space in buffer for string data.

EXAMPLE
-------
See *ubftest/test_badd.c* for sample code.
