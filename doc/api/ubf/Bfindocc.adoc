NAME
----
Bfindocc - find field occurrence in buffer by given value


SYNOPSIS
--------

#include <ubf.h>

BFLDOCC Bfindocc (UBFH *'p_ub', BFLDID 'bfldid', char *'buf', BFLDLEN 'len');

Link with '-lubf -lnstd -lm -lpthread'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Function on success returns the occurrence of the field found in 'p_ub' buffer. 
The value is searched by 'buf'/'len' pair which value matches the field value. 
For *BFLD_STRING* typed fields value present in 'buf' is treated as 
regular expression which is matched against field value in UBF buffer.
'p_ub' is pointer to UBF buffer, 'bfldid' is field id to search for, 'len' is 
input parameter for indicating the 'but' length in bytes. Then 'len' is 
mandatory only for *BFLD_CARRAY* fields.

In case if searching for *BFLD_VIEW* field, the 'buf' shall point to initialized
*BVIEWFLD* structure where *vname* field shall be set to view name and *data* shall
be set to pointer to actual view field to compare in search.

RETURN VALUE
------------
On success, *Bfindocc()* return occurrence where the value is found; on error, 
-1 is returned, with *Berror* set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
------
Note that *Bstrerror()* returns generic error message plus custom message 
with debug info from last function call.

*BALIGNERR* Corrupted buffer or pointing to not aligned memory area.

*BNOTFLD* Buffer not fielded, not correctly allocated or corrupted.

*BNOTPRES* Field not present.

*BEINVAL* 'buf' is NULL.

*BBADFLD* invalid field passed in (type incorrect).

EXAMPLE
-------
See *ubftest/test_find.c* for sample code.
