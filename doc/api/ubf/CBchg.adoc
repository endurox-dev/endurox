NAME
----
CBchg - Convert and change (add/update) field occurrance in UBF buffer


SYNOPSIS
--------

#include <ubf.h>

int CBchg (UBFH *'p_ub', BFLDID 'bfldid', BFLDOCC 'occ', char *'buf', BFLDLEN 'len', int 'usrtype');

Link with '-lubf -lnstd -lm -lpthread'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Change (add or update) field in UBF buffer by converting given user type 'usrtype' to buffer field's type (see BFLD_* types). The UBF buffer pointer is passed by 'p_ub', field id in 'bfldid'. 'occ' is occurrance to change. The user field value is passed in 'buf'. The 'len' is used only if 'usrtype' is *BFLD_CARRAY*, for which length cannot be detected from passed data.

If 'occ' is bigger than last existing index+1 in buffer then non existing occurrences (which are not being set by this function) are initialised with defaults. For numerics it is 0, for *BFLD_CHAR* it is 0x00, for *BFLD_STRING* it is empty string, for *BFLD_CARRAY* it is empty byte array (with length 0).

RETURN VALUE
------------
On success, *CBchg()* return zero; on error, -1 is returned, with *Berror* set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
------
Note that *Bstrerror()* returns generic error message plus custom message with debug info from last function call.

*BALIGNERR* Corrupted buffer or pointing to not aligned memory area.

*BNOTFLD* Buffer not fielded, not correctly allocated or corrupted.

*BNOSPACE* No space in buffer for string data.

*BMALLOC* Failed to allocate type conversion buffer.

*BBADFLD* Invalid field id passed.

EXAMPLE
-------
See *ubftest/test_cbchg.c* for sample code.
