NAME

tpext_addpollerfd - XATMI extension, add poller FD


SYNOPSIS
--------
#include <atmi.h>

int tpext_addpollerfd(int 'fd', uint32_t 'events', void *'ptr1', int (*'p_pollevent')(int 'fd', uint32_t 'events', void *'ptr1'));

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This is XATMI Enduro/X extension function, which allows to add custom file descriptor ('fd') for monitoring events in Enudor/X main poll routine. The 'events' are corresponding events for *epoll()* if running on Linux and configured for epoll, or events for *poll()* if running on non Linux or configured to use poll. If for example you want to monitor socket file descriptor for incoming events, then for epoll this would be "*EPOLLET* | *EPOLLIN* | *EPOLLHUP*", for poll this would be "*POLLIN*". Then 'ptr1' is custom pointer that will be passed to callback function. 'p_pollevent' is callback function which is called by Enduro/X main loop in case if for 'fd' specified events are received. 'events' in 'p_pollevent' contains the received events. The 'ptr1' for 'p_pollevent' contains the original pointer passed to *tpext_addpollerfd()*.

When 'p_pollevent' callback is called, then return value for success must be 0, otherwise it is assumed as failure. In case of callback failure, XATMI server program is terminated with failure.

The custom poller can be added only after the init stage. I.e. it cannot be done at *tpsvrinit()* function. Normally application registers periodic callback function with *tpext_addperiodcb()*, where into this callback *tpext_addpollerfd()* is called.

This function is available only for XATMI servers.

RETURN VALUE
------------
On success, *tpext_addpollerfd()* return zero; on error, -1 is returned, with *tperrno* set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
------
Note that *tpstrerror()* for returns generic error message plus custom message with debug info from last call.

*TPEMATCH* File descriptor ('fd') already registered for callback function.

*TPEPROTO* Function called in invalid XATMI server stage. I.e. it cannot be called from *tpsvrinit()*.

*TPESYSTEM* System failure occurred during serving. See logs i.e. user log, or debugs for more info.

*TPEOS* System failure occurred during serving. See logs i.e. user log, or debugs for more info. That could insufficient memory or other error.
