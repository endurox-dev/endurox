NAME
----
tpopen - Open XA sub-system, connect to XA resource manager


SYNOPSIS
--------
#include <atmi.h>

int tpopen (void);

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Connect to the XA resource manager. Note that environment for process must be configured, so that Enduro/X can load correct resource manager drivers. See the *ex_env(5)* man page for environment variables, that must be set. Basically Enduro/X will dynamically load library set in *NDRX_XA_DRIVERLIB* env variable. This is the driver which provides in unified way of getting *xa_switch*. As the xa_switches can be located in different Resource Managers, the second library migth be need to load and that is marked in *NDRX_XA_RMLIB* env variable. The resource manager ID is set in *NDRX_XA_RES_ID* env variable. If your application needs different resource managers or different transaction branches, then you can use environment variable override functionality, see *ex_envover(5)* and *ndrxconfig.xml(5)*. XA connection strings for Enduro/X drivers are stored into *NDRX_XA_OPEN_STR* and *NDRX_XA_CLOSE_STR* variables. Enduro/X will try to init XA sub-system  as soon as possible (i.e. load drivers, etc.). If you want to delay this till actual *tpopen()*, then you may set *NDRX_XA_LAZY_INIT* to 1. 

This function at lowest level, basically calls XA switches *xa_open_entry()* function with *NDRX_XA_OPEN_STR* string.

If *tpopen()* was already call and XA is initialised, then function will succeed, and no error will be generated.

RETURN VALUE
------------
On success, *tpopen()* return zero; on error, -1 is returned, with *tperrno* set to indicate the error.


ERRORS
------
Note that *tpstrerror()* returns generic error message plus custom message with debug info from last function call.


*TPERMERR* Resource Manager failed. The *tpstrerror()* will provide more info from last call.

*TPESYSTEM* System failure occurred during serving. See logs i.e. user log, or debugs for more info. This could also be a problem with dynamical driver loading.

*TPEOS* System failure occurred during serving. See logs i.e. user log, or debugs for more info.
