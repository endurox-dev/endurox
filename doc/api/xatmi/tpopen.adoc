NAME
----
tpopen - Open XA sub-system, connect to XA resource manager


SYNOPSIS
--------
#include <atmi.h>

int tpopen (void);

For XATMI client link with '-latmiclt -latmi -lubf -lnstd -lpthread -lrt -lm'

For XATMI server link with '-latmisrv|-latmisrvnomain|-latmisrvinteg -latmi -lubf -lnstd -lpthread -lrt -lm'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Connect to the XA resource manager. Note that environment for process must be 
configured, so that Enduro/X can load correct resource manager drivers. 
See the *ex_env(5)* man page for environment variables, that must be set. 
Basically Enduro/X will dynamically load library set in *NDRX_XA_DRIVERLIB* env 
variable. This is the driver which provides in unified way of getting *xa_switch*. 
As the xa_switches can be located in different Resource Managers, the second 
library might be need to load and that is marked in *NDRX_XA_RMLIB* env variable. 
The resource manager ID is set in *NDRX_XA_RES_ID* env variable. If your 
application needs different resource managers or different transaction branches, 
then you can use environment variable override functionality, see *ex_envover(5)* 
and *ndrxconfig.xml(5)*. XA connection strings for Enduro/X drivers are stored 
into *NDRX_XA_OPEN_STR* and *NDRX_XA_CLOSE_STR* variables. Enduro/X will try 
to init XA sub-system  as soon as possible (i.e. load drivers, etc.). 
If you want to delay this till actual *tpopen()*, 
then you may set *NDRX_XA_LAZY_INIT* to 1. 

This function at lowest level, basically calls XA switches *xa_open_entry()* 
function with *NDRX_XA_OPEN_STR* string.

If *tpopen()* was already call and XA is initialized, then function will succeed,
 and no error will be generated.

RETURN VALUE
------------
On success, *tpopen()* return zero; on error, -1 is returned, with 
*tperrno* set to indicate the error.


ERRORS
------
Note that *tpstrerror()* returns generic error message plus custom message 
with debug info from last function call.

*TPERMERR* Resource Manager failed. The *tpstrerror()* will provide more 
info from last call.

*TPESYSTEM* System failure occurred during serving. See logs i.e. 
user log, or debugs for more info. This could also be a 
problem with dynamical driver loading.

*TPEOS* System failure occurred during serving. See logs i.e. user log, 
or debugs for more info.

EXAMPLE
-------
