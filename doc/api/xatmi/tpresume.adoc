NAME
----
tpresume - Resume global transaction


SYNOPSIS
--------
#include <atmi.h>

int tpresume (TPTRANID *'tranid', long 'flags');

For XATMI client link with '-latmiclt -latmi -lubf -lnstd -lpthread -lrt -lm'

For XATMI server link with '-latmisrv|-latmisrvnomain|-latmisrvinteg -latmi -lubf -lnstd -lpthread -lrt -lm'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Resume global transaction with given transaction data in 'tranid' parameter. 
'trandid' previously must be set by *tpsuspend(3)* call. To resume global transaction, 
XA sub-system must be open, by *tpopen(3)*. Technically it is possible that 
resume is done by other process than which did the suspend.

*Valid flags*

*TPTXNOOPTIM* Do not use cached known resource managers in 'tranid'. Thus having
this flag set, this process even for previously involved RMs will perform 
xa transaction start and if that fails, then attempt *TM_JOIN*.

*TPTXTMSUSPEND* Indicates that 'tranid' was suspended with this flag (i.e.
which resulted in *TMSUSPEND* xa flag). And now transaction would be resumed
with *TMRESUME* xa flag instead of *TMJOIN*. This applies to XA switches 
which support join operation (i.e. is not disabled by *NOJOIN* or
*NOSUSPEND* in *NDRX_XA_FLAGS*).

RETURN VALUE
------------
On success, *tpresume()* return zero; on error, -1 is returned, 
with *tperrno* set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
------
Note that *tpstrerror()* returns generic error message plus custom message 
with debug info from last function call.

*TPEINVAL* Flags was not 0. Or 'tranid' was NULL.

*TPEPROTO* Global transaction is already started.

*TPESYSTEM* System failure occurred during serving. See logs i.e. user log, or 
debugs for more info. Could be the case if XA sub-system is not open by *tpopen()*.
Transaction was expired at *tmsrv(8)*.

*TPEOS* System failure occurred during serving. See logs i.e. user log, 
or debugs for more info.
