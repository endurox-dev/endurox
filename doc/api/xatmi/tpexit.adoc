NAME
----
tpexit - Terminate server process


SYNOPSIS
--------
#include <atmi.h>

void tpexit(void);


For XATMI client link with '-latmiclt -latmi -lubf -lnstd -lpthread -lrt -lm'

For XATMI server link with '-latmisrv|-latmisrvnomain|-latmisrvinteg -latmi -lubf -lnstd -lpthread -lrt -lm'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This function is designated for use in XATMI servers. Function requests the
main thread loop to perform XATMI server process shutdown procedure. If server
process currently serves a service call and in service code tpexit() is called,
then after service returns, the XATMI server process main loop will terminate
and will invoke the *tpsvrdone(3)* and *tpsvrthrdone(3)* accordingly. Normally
tpexit() after the call returns the control to the caller.

Once process is shutdown, the *ndrxd(8)* will restart the process (if restarts of 
dead are configured).

tpexit() can be called from other threads than main. In that case if server main
thread is idling, the shutdown process will take a place immediately.

Internally tpexit() sends the administrative shutdown message to it self.
If admin queue at the moment is full (blocking), the tpexit() will perform direct
exit(-1) of the process, without performing clean shutdown i.e. 
*tpsvrdone(3)* and *tpsvrthrdone(3)* callbacks will not be invoked.

When *tpreturn(3)* is called with *TPEXIT* flag, internally this function is invoked.

If ATMI client process calls this function (i.e. linked with libatmiclt), exit(-1)
is always called.
