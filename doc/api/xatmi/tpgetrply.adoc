NAME
----
tpgetrply - Get reply from asynchronous service call


SYNOPSIS
--------
#include <atmi.h>

int tpgetrply(int \*'cd', char **'data', long *'len', long 'flags');


For XATMI client link with '-latmiclt -latmi -lubf -lnstd -lpthread -lrt -lm'

For XATMI server link with '-latmisrv|-latmisrvnomain|-latmisrvinteg -latmi -lubf -lnstd -lpthread -lrt -lm'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Get the response from asynchronous service call. The 'cd' is pointer to call 
descriptor to which value might be set, in that case only matched reply is 
returned, other messages are dropped. 'data' and 'len' are field used for 
storing the reply messages. Fields must be allocated by *tpalloc()*. 
In case if *TPGETANY* flag is used, then any first response which is 
received is returned to user application.

*Valid flags*

*TPGETANY* Return first response message received. The connection identifier is 
stored into 'cd'.

*TPNOBLOCK* Do not block for waiting on response message. Instead function 
returns with 'cd' equals to 0. And function return result is SUCCEED (0).

*TPSIGRSTRT* Restart the system call in progress if interrupted by signal handler. 
This affects only underlaying mq_* function calls.

*TPNOTIME* Ignore timeout setting (*NDRX_TOUT* env variable). 
Wait for reply for indefinitely.

*TPNOCHANGE* Do not allow to change the reply buffer type. If flag is set and 
different buffer type is received than original, then error *TPEINVAL* is returned.

*TPNOABORT* Do not abort global transaction (if one in progress), even if service
failed.

If case if reply was requested for particular 'cd' and timeout was received 
(*TPETIME*), function does not cancel the 'cd'. Thus if server process
the request slower than timeout value, still it is possible to receive the
response data with several tpgetrply() attempts on particular 'cd'.

RETURN VALUE
------------
On success, *tpgetrply()* returns 0; on error, -1 is returned, with 
*tperrno* set to indicate the error.


ERRORS
------
Note that *tpstrerror()* for last calls returns generic error message plus 
custom message with debug info from last call.

*TPEBLOCK* *TPENOBLOCK* was specified in flags and no message is in queue.

*TPEINVAL* Invalid parameter is given to function. Particularly pointer 
parameters are NULL.

*TPEBADDESC* 'cd' parameter points to not issued or canceled call descriptor
and *TPGETANY* flag was not specified.

*TPETIME* Service did not reply in given time ('NDRX_TOUT' time). 

*TPESVCFAIL* Service returned 'TPFAIL'. This is application level failure.

*TPESVCERR* System level service failure. Server died during the message presence 
in service queue.

*TPESYSTEM* System failure occurred during serving. See logs i.e. user log, or 
debugs for more info.

*TPEOS* System failure occurred during serving. See logs i.e. user log, or 
debugs for more info.
