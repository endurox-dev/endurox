:doctype: manpage


NAME
----
tx_open - Open XA sub-system, connect from XA resource manager


SYNOPSIS
--------
#include <tx.h>

int tx_open(void);

For XATMI client link with '-latmiclt -latmi -lubf -lnstd -lpthread -lrt -lm'

For XATMI server link with '-latmisrv|-latmisrvnomain|-latmisrvinteg -latmi -lubf -lnstd -lpthread -lrt -lm'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Connect to the XA resource manager. Note that environment for process must be 
configured, so that Enduro/X can load correct resource manager drivers. 
See the *ex_env(5)* man page for environment variables, that must be set. 
Basically Enduro/X will dynamically load library set in *NDRX_XA_DRIVERLIB* env 
variable. This is the driver which provides in unified way of getting *xa_switch*. 
As the xa_switches can be located in different Resource Managers, the second 
library might be need to load and that is marked in *NDRX_XA_RMLIB* env variable. 
The resource manager ID is set in *NDRX_XA_RES_ID* env variable. If your 
application needs different resource managers or different transaction branches, 
then you can use environment variable override functionality, see *ex_envover(5)* 
and *ndrxconfig.xml(5)*. XA connection strings for Enduro/X drivers are stored 
into *NDRX_XA_OPEN_STR* and *NDRX_XA_CLOSE_STR* variables. Enduro/X will try 
to init XA sub-system  as soon as possible (i.e. load drivers, etc.). 
If to delay initial XA drivers loading till actual *tx_open(3)* call, 
then environment variable *NDRX_XA_LAZY_INIT* should be set to 1. 

This function at lowest level, basically calls XA switches *xa_open_entry()* 
function with *NDRX_XA_OPEN_STR* string.

If *tx_open(3)* was already called and XA is initialized, then function will succeed,
 and no error will be generated.

TX API is base on TP API. This function is based on *tpclose(3)* and it is possible
to mix these two API kinds.


RETURN VALUE
------------
On success, *tx_close()* return *TX_OK*; on error, error code is returned

ERRORS
------

*TX_FAIL* Failed to open XA resource (cannot load Enduro/X XA driver, cannot
load resource manager driver or resource manager returned

EXAMPLE
-------
See *atmitest/test021_xafull/atmiclt21tx.c* for sample code.
