SYNOPSIS

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Restore context data from previously saved (*tpsrvgetctxdata()*) context data. 
The 'data' field is value returned by *tpsrvgetctxdata()*. This function is 
needed for multi threaded server, in order to restore tpcall() data in worker thread. 
If global transaction was running in main thread for which *tpsrvgetctxdata()* 
was called, then *tpsrvsetctxdata()* will resume the global transaction in current thread.

In case when restoring context in other server process service, the
auto-buffer marking (buffer allocated by incoming message service dispatcher and
marked as auto-buffer) is lost. Thus when doing *tpreturn(3)* 
or *tpforward(3)* with other buffer, than original service 
incoming call buffer, the original call buffer (initial auto-buffer) will leak. By
contrast of normal service work, where *tpsrvsetctxdata()* is not used, the 
auto-buffer will be freed by system, even doing return with other XATMI buffer.

Thus to avoid leaking, either *tpreturn()* or *tpforward()* shall be done with original
call buffer, or if not possible, then after doing *tpsrvsetctxdata()*, original
call buffer shall be freed by *tpfree(3)*.

This function is available only for XATMI servers.

*Valid flags*

*TPNOAUTBUF* Do not restore auto buffer when restoring the server context. 
This can be suitable in case if buffer is already made free by initial service thread
and the target server/service does not know anything about given pointer. E.g.
the context is copied to different process. If context is copied to other process
without using this flag, then segmentation fault is possible at *tpreturn()*
or *tpforward()*.

RETURN VALUE
------------
On success, *tpsrvsetctxdata()* return pointer to context data block; on error, 
NULL is returned, with *tperrno* set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
------
Note that *tpstrerror()* returns generic error message plus custom message with 
debug info from last function call.

*TPEINVAL* 'data' is NULL.

*TPEPROTO* Global transaction is already started.

*TPESYSTEM* System failure occurred during serving. See logs i.e. user log, or 
debugs for more info. Could be the case if XA sub-system is not open by *tpopen()*.

*TPEOS* System failure occurred during serving. See logs i.e. user log, or debugs for more info.

EXAMPLE
-------
