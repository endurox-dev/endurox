DESCRIPTION
-----------
Restore context data from previously saved (*tpsrvgetctxdata()*) context data. 
The 'data' field is value returned by *tpsrvgetctxdata()*. This function is 
needed for multi threaded server, in order to restore tpcall() data in worker thread. 
If global transaction was running in main thread for which *tpsrvgetctxdata()* 
was called, then *tpsrvsetctxdata()* will resume the global transaction in current thread.

This function is available only for XATMI servers.

*Valid flags*

*TPNOAUTBUF* Do not restore auto buffer when restoring the server context. 
This can be suitable in case if buffer is already made free by initial service thread
and the target server/service does not know anything about given pointer. E.g.
the context is copied to different process.

RETURN VALUE
------------
On success, *tpsrvsetctxdata()* return pointer to context data block; on error, 
NULL is returned, with *tperrno* set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
------
Note that *tpstrerror()* returns generic error message plus custom message with 
debug info from last function call.

*TPEINVAL* 'data' is NULL.

*TPEPROTO* Global transaction is already started.

*TPESYSTEM* System failure occurred during serving. See logs i.e. user log, or debugs for more info. Could be the case if XA sub-system is not open by *tpopen()*.

*TPEOS* System failure occurred during serving. See logs i.e. user log, or debugs for more info.
