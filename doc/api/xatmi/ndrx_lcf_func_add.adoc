NAME
----
ndrx_lcf_func_add - Register LCF command callback function


SYNOPSIS
--------
#include <lcf.h>

#include <nerror.h>

int ndrx_lcf_func_add(ndrx_lcf_reg_func_t *'cfunc');

Link with '-lnstd -lpthread -lrt -lm'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Function is used to add callback handler for LCF command. Command data and callback
is configured in 'cfunc' argument structure. The commands for any process may be
registered via Enduro/X plugin interface, see *ex_devguide(guides)*.

*Limited use of Enduro/X functions within callback*

LCF callback are activated at debug log points at any portion of Enduro/X code
and also in user code if *tplog(3)* or TP_LOG() macros are used. Thus it is impossible
to guaranty that current XATMI context will be able to do things like *tpcall(3)*,
or some UBF buffer manipulations. As callbacks by them selves may be activated 
from such region. Or from some points where Enduro/X holds mutex locks. That might
lead to deadlocks or incorrect/corrupted working further working of the process.
To do some XATMI/UBF related works, it is recommended that new thread is started
from callback function. Or other option is to set some global variable which later
is processed by normal user code.

Following list of functions is safe to use from callbacks:

- Logging: *tplog(3)*, *tplogdump(3)*, *tplogdumpdiff(3)*, *TP_LOG()*, *TP_DUMP()*, *TP_DUMP_DIFF()*


*ndrx_lcf_reg_func_t structure is declared as:*

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

typedef struct
{
    int version;
    int command;
    char cmdstr[NDRX_LCF_ADMINCMD_MAX+1];
    int (*pf_callback)(ndrx_lcf_command_t *cmd, long *p_flags);
} ndrx_lcf_reg_func_t;

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Where *ndrx_lcf_reg_xadmin_t* fields shall be filled in following way:

'version' - Actual version is present in macros *NDRX_LCF_CCMD_VERSION* (currently it is *1*).

'command' - This is actual command code. Must be value in range of 
*NDRX_LCF_CMD_MIN_CUST*..*NDRX_LCF_CMD_MAX_CUST*.

'cmdstr' - Is command string used in xadmin lcf COMMAND. It must be valid C style
identifier. Max command string length is *32+1*.

'pf_callback' - Callback function. It receives copy of shared memory command
object present in 'cmd' variable. The callback function can return feedback code
and feedback message. The values shall be loaded in 'cmd' variable fields (bellow)
and corresponding flags *NDRX_LCF_FLAG_FBACK_CODE* and/or *NDRX_LCF_FLAG_FBACK_MSG*
shall be set. In case of success callback shall return *0* which is accounted
in shared memory statistics for given command.


*ndrx_lcf_command_t structure is declared as:*

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

typedef struct
{
    int    version;
    unsigned  cmdversion;                         
    char cmdstr[NDRX_LCF_ADMINCMD_MAX+1];
    ndrx_stopwatch_t publtim;
    int    command;
    char   arg_a[PATH_MAX+1];
    char   arg_b[NAME_MAX+1];
    long   flags;
    char   procid[NAME_MAX];
    int    applied;
    int    failed;
    int    seen;
    long   fbackcode;
    char   fbackmsg[NDRX_LCF_FEEDBACK_BUF];
    
} ndrx_lcf_command_t;

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Where *ndrx_lcf_command_t* fields is filled in following way:

'version' - Version number which structure was posted.

'cmdversion' - Posting number (to detect that command is runnable).

'cmdstr' - Command string.

'publtim' - Command age in Enduro/X stopwatch time.

'command' - Command code published.

'arg_a' - Argument -A value passed in xadmin lcf COMMAND -A <VALUE>

'arg_b' - Argument -B value passed in xadmin lcf COMMAND -B <VALUE>

'flags' - Any *NDRX_LCF_FLAG* flags. Except *NDRX_LCF_FLAG_FBACK_CODE* or *NDRX_LCF_FLAG_FBACK_MSG*.

'procid' - Pid if *flags* contains *NDRX_LCF_FLAG_PID* (posting by pid) 
    or Process name if *flags* contains *NDRX_LCF_FLAG_BIN* (posting by binary name). 
    In regexp mode *NDRX_LCF_FLAG_DOREX* contains regexp expression.

'applied' - Number of processes applied command, this is up till execution in
    current binary. *NOTE* for performance reasons, this value is no synchronized between
    other processes.

'failed' - Number of processes failed to execute command, this is up till execution in
    current binary. *NOTE* for performance reasons, this value is no synchronized between
    other processes.

'seen' - Number of processes seen this command but not matched for execution, this is up till execution in
    current binary. *NOTE* for performance reasons, this value is no synchronized between
    other processes.

'fbackcode' - this field may be used by callback function to return the value to
    and store it in shared memory. Value is copied to shm in case if *p_flags* is
    set to *NDRX_LCF_FLAG_FBACK_CODE*. NOTE! value copy is not synchronized between
    processes and latest process (if several are doing feedback) will survive in
    results.

'fbackmsg' - this field may be used by callback function to return the value to
    and store it in shared memory. Value is copied to shm in case if *p_flags* is
    set to *NDRX_LCF_FLAG_FBACK_MSG*. Buffer size is *64*. The data returned must
    be zero terminated string. NOTE! value copy is not synchronized between
    processes and latest process (if several are doing feedback) will survive in
    results.

RETURN VALUE
------------
On success, *ndrx_lcf_func_add()* returns 0. On error, -1 is returned, with 
*Nerror* set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
------
Note that *Nstrerror()* returns generic error message plus custom message 
with debug info from last function call.

*NEINVAL* 'cfunc' is NULL. 'cfunc->cmdstr' is NULL. 'cfunc->pf_callback' is NULL.

*NEVERSION* Invalid version specified in structure.

*NEEXISTS* Callback for command code in 'cfunc->command' is already registered.

*NEMALLOC* Malloc failed.

THREAD SAFETY
-------------
*ndrx_lcf_func_add()* function is thread safe.

-------
