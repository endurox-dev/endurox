DESCRIPTION
-----------
Function is used to terminate service processing and return control to caller. 
The return buffer 'data' must be auto buffer or allocated by *tpalloc()*. In either
case the buffer's are made free by Enduro/X. I.e. The original request buffer
is made free (if available) and the return buffer is made free too, if different
than request buffer. 

Normally the auto-buffer shall not be made free by user, as that will cause the
corruption at the stage of the *tpreturn*. But auto-buffer free by user can be
suitable in case if doing call state transfer over the non XATMI sub-system, 
then call context restore in other OS process with *tpsrvsetctxdata(3)* 
must be done with *TPNOAUTBUF* flag specified, and the original service which 
received request prior doing *tpcontinue(3)* shall make the auto buffer free *tpfree(3)*.
If the 'TPNOAUTBUF' was specified at state restore, then tpreturn() command will
not try to free the auto buffer.

'Len' is needed in case if buffer type is not self describing. Internally function uses 
long jump to get back to internal message polling mechanisms. *tpreturn()* is 
used for normal service calls and for conversational service calls. *tpdiscon()* 
shall not be used by service program, but use *tpreturn()* instead. 'rcode' 
field is used by user program, to return back the specific value to caller.

*'rval'* values:

*TPSUCCESS* service terminated with success.

*TPFAIL* service terminated with failure. In case of global transaction, this 
return value will mark it as abort only.

*'flags'* values:

*TPSOFTTIMEOUT* soft timeout occurred. This can be used to simulate *TPETIME* 
error for caller. In this case 'rcode' is set to *TPETIME*, that is later used 
at client side for *tpreturn(3)* to respond with XATMI error.

*TPSOFTERR* software generate XATMI error code. In this case 'rcode' indicates
the error code to be returned to service caller.

This function is available only for XATMI servers.

RETURN VALUE
------------
Function is marked as void and it have no return values.

No errors available (but some details migth be logged in trace files).
