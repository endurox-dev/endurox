DESCRIPTION
-----------
Function is used to terminate service processing and return control to caller. 
The return buffer 'data' must be auto buffer or allocated by *tpalloc()*. In either
case the buffer's are made free by Enduro/X. I.e. The original request buffer
is made free (if available) and the return buffer is made free too, if different
than request buffer. 

In case if doing call state transfer over the non XATMI sub-system, then at doing
*tpsrvsetctxdata(3)* the flag *TPNOAUTBUF* flag must be specified, and the original
transaction received prior doing *tpcontinue(3)* shall make the auto buffer free.

Normally the auto-buffer shall not be made free by user, as that will cause the
corruption at the state of the *tpreturn*.

'Len' is needed in case if buffer type is not self describing. Internally function uses 
long jump to get back to internal message polling mechanisms. *tpreturn()* is 
used for normal service calls and for conversational service calls. *tpdiscon()* 
shall not be used by service program, but use *tpreturn()* instead. 'rcode' 
field is used by user program, to return back the specific value to caller.

*'rval'* values:

*TPSUCCESS* service terminated with success.

*TPFAIL* service terminated with failure. In case of global transaction, this 
return value will mark it as abort only.

*'flags'* values:

*TPSOFTTIMEOUT* soft timeout occurred. This can be used to simulate *TPETIME* 
error for caller. In this case 'rcode' is set to *TPETIME*, that is later used 
at client side for *tpreturn(3)* to respond with XATMI error.


This function is available only for XATMI servers.

RETURN VALUE
------------
Function is marked as void and it have no return values.


ERRORS
------
No errors available (but some details migth be logged in trace files).
