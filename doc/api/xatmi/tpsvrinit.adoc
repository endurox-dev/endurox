NAME
----
tpsvrinit - Template for server init function


SYNOPSIS
--------
#include <atmi.h>

int tpsvrinit (int 'argc', char **'argv');


For XATMI client link with '-latmiclt -latmi -lubf -lnstd -lpthread -lrt -lm'

For XATMI server link with '-latmisrv|-latmisrvnomain|-latmisrvinteg -latmi -lubf -lnstd -lpthread -lrt -lm'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This function is called upon server startup. Before the services are advertise, 
this function is activated. The 'argc' and 'argv' is command line parameters 
passed to binary after the '--'. Initial parameters are used by Enduro/X, 
these are sys-opts in the *ndrxconfig.xml*, after the '--' those are 
application specific options.

Normally at *tpsvrinit()* XATMI server does the *tpadvertise()*, and initialize 
other resources, like calling *tpopen()*. Any advertise done here, actually 
takes a part when function returns.

The function can be exposed to Enduro/X system in different ways:

1. If server binary is linked with '-latmisrv', then server must 
contain public (non static) function of *tpsvrinit()*.

2. If server binary is linked with '-latmisrvnomain', then above (1) 
rule still applies. But in this case the caller's *main()* must invoke *ndrx_main()* function.

3. If server binary is linked with '-latmisrvinteg', then functions 
*tpsvrinit()* and tpsvrdone()* must be passed to *ndrx_main_integra()* function. 
Or if starting server by *_tmstartserver()* - built by *buildserver(8)*, 
function must pointer must be present in 'tmsvrargs_t'.

Library 'atmisrvinteg' provides built in version of *tpsvrinit()* function. Function
may be used only if starting server with *_tmstartserver(3)* (or was built by
*buildserver(8)*). The default *tpsvrinit()* function, in case if application was
not built for multi-threading (extern variable '_tmbuilt_with_thread_option' set to 0 
or buildserver '-t' not set), 
calls *tpsvrthrinit(3)* from the 'tmsvrargs_t'.
In case there were no *tpsvrthrinit(3)* provided, the default *tpsvrthrinit()* is
used also from 'atmisrvinteg' library. The default version of *tpsvrthrinit(3)* calls
*tx_open(3)*.

This only applies to XATMI servers.

RETURN VALUE
------------
If application failed to initialize, the user shall return non 0 value. 
If succeed, then 0 must be returned.

ERRORS
------
Not available.
