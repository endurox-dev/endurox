NAME
----
tpinit - Initialize Enduro/x environment


SYNOPSIS
--------
#include <atmi.h>

int tpinit(TPINIT *'tpinfo');


For XATMI client link with '-latmiclt -latmi -lubf -lnstd -lpthread -lrt -lm'

For XATMI server link with '-latmisrv|-latmisrvnomain|-latmisrvinteg -latmi 
-lubf -lnstd -lpthread -lrt -lm'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Function is intended to be called by XATMI clients, to initialize XATMI session.
'tpinfo' is defined as:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
struct  tpinfo_t
{
        char usrname[MAXTIDENT+2];
        char cltname[MAXTIDENT+2];
        char passwd[MAXTIDENT+2];
        char grpname[MAXTIDENT+2];
        long flags;
        long datalen;
        long data;
};
typedef struct  tpinfo_t TPINIT;
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If 'tpinfo->cltname' is set, then it is using for client process identification.
If it is not set, then client process is identified as executable name. 
Other fields of 'tpinfo' are reserved for future use. 'tpinfo' can bet set to *NULL*. 
Function can be used also by ATMI server's worker threads, to initialize them. 
How ever call of *tpinit()* is optional, as it is automaitcally issued, then 
any of tp\* commands are invoked. At current Enduro/X version it is 
recommended to use *tpinit()* with NULL parameter. Also when client process 
does threading, then each thread needs to call *tpinit()* or it will be 
automatically invoked as described before. Each new thread have it's own thread 
local storage (TLS), which describes Enduro/X state, thus new thread will 
get un-initialised TLS which results in need of calling *tpinit()*.

Internally function opens any Posix queues needed by client, reads the environment 
variables and initializes XA sub-system, if configured and not set to lazy.

*Valid flags for TPINIT.flags* 

*TPU_IGN* Ignore (drop) incoming unsolicited messages.

RETURN VALUE
------------
On success, *tpinit()* returns 0. On error, -1 is returned, with *tperrno* set 
to indicate the error.

ERRORS
------
Note that *tpstrerror()* returns generic error message plus custom message with 
debug info from last function call.

*TPEINVAL* Environment variables not configured, see *ex_env(5)* page.

*TPESYSTEM* System failure occurred during serving. See logs i.e. user log, or 
debugs for more info.

*TPEOS* System failure occurred during serving. See logs i.e. user log, or 
debugs for more info.
