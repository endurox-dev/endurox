DESCRIPTION
-----------
Subscribe to event. This is API function for Enduro/X event broker services. In order to get the functionality working, then event server must be started and configured. See *tpevsrv(8)* manpage. 'eventexpr' is regular expression syntax based expression which is registered into event broker, so that if it is matched then event is posted to service, written in 'ctl->name1' field. Note that many servers with the same service can subscribe to same event. All server's services will receive the event. 'filter' is boolean expression for *UBF* or regular expression for *STRING* buffer which are extra expression to be tested, when event name matched. If 'filter' is true or *NULL*, then event is posted to service.

The *TPEVCTL* structure is following:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

struct tpevctl_t
{
    long flags;
    char name1[XATMI_SERVICE_NAME_LENGTH];
    char name2[XATMI_SERVICE_NAME_LENGTH];
};
typedef struct tpevctl_t TPEVCTL;

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

'ctl->name2' is reserved for future use.


*Valid flags*

*TPNOTRAN* Do not call service in transaction mode. This is effective in case if caller process is running in transaction mode, but destination process shall not run in the same global transaction

*TPSIGRSTRT* Restart the system call in progress if interrupted by signal handler. This affects only underlaying mq_* function calls.

*TPNOTIME* Ignore timeout setting (*NDRX_TOUT* env variable). Wait for reply for infinitely.

*Valid ctl->flags*

*TPEVSERVICE* Call the service. Note that service will be called with flags which are present at 'ctl->flags' | *TPNOREPLY*.

*TPEVPERSIST* Do not remove service for event brokers registry, if service is not available any more (detected at point *tpcall()* to service failed).

This function is available only for XATMI servers.

RETURN VALUE
------------
On success, *tpsubscribe()* return subscribtion id; on error, -1 is returned, with *tperrno* set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
------
Note that *tpstrerror()* returns generic error message plus custom message with debug info from last function call.

*TPEINVAL* Invalid parameter is given to function. Event expression is *NULL* or empty. Event expression is longer than 255 bytes, 'ctl' is NULL, or 'clt->name1' is empty or filter is set and longer than 255 bytes.

*TPENOENT* Event server is not available.

*TPETIME* Service did not reply in given time ('NDRX_TOUT'). 

*TPESVCFAIL* Service returned 'TPFAIL'. This is application level failure.

*TPESVCERR* System level service failure. Server died during the message presence in service queue.

*TPESYSTEM* System failure occurred during serving. See logs i.e. user log, or debugs for more info.

*TPEOS* System failure occurred during serving. See logs i.e. user log, or debugs for more info.
