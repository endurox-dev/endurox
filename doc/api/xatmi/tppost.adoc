tppost - Post event


SYNOPSIS
--------
#include <atmi.h>

int tppost (char *'eventname', char *'data', long 'len', long 'flags');


DESCRIPTION
-----------
Post event to event broker. This function will call the event server's *@TPEVPOST* service. Which will broadcast the 'eventname' event and 'data', 'len' buffer to servers subscribed to even, if event mask and filter matches the event name and buffer passed to. 'data' can be NULL buffer. If not NULL, then it must be allocated by *tpalloc()*, the 'len' is mandatory for types which does not contain self described length. The event brokers will broadcast event also to connected bridges. On return function returns number of servers consumed the event. This includes also number of servers consumed events on remote hosts.

*Valid flags*

*TPNOTRAN* Do not call service in transaction mode. This is effective in case if caller process is running in transaction mode, but destination process shall not run in the same global transaction

*TPNOREPLY* Do not wait for reply from event server. In this case number of applied events will be 0.

*TPSIGRSTRT* Restart the system call in progress if interrupted by signal handler. This affects only underlaying mq_* function calls.

*TPNOTIME* Ignore timeout setting (*NDRX_TOUT* env variable). Wait for reply for infinitely.
