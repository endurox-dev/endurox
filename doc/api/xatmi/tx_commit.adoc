============
:doctype: manpage


NAME
----
tx_commit - Commit a global transaction


SYNOPSIS
--------
#include <tx.h>

int tx_commit(void);

For XATMI client link with '-latmiclt -latmi -lubf -lnstd -lpthread -lrt -lm'

For XATMI server link with '-latmisrv|-latmisrvnomain|-latmisrvinteg -latmi -lubf -lnstd -lpthread -lrt -lm'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Function commits global transaction associated with current thread
previously started by *tx_begin(3)*. If transaction control was changed by
*tx_set_transaction_control(3)* flag *TX_CHAINED*, the new transaction is started
immediately after the commit.

If commit return was altered by *tx_set_commit_return(3)* and setting flag was
set to *TX_COMMIT_DECISION_LOGGED*, the function will return after transaction
is prepared by resource managers, and final commit (second phase of transaction)
is left for transaction manager (*tmsrv(8)*) to complete by background thread,
executed periodically (configured by *-s* scan time CLI parameter to *tmsrv*).

Function use following attributes set by:

- *tx_set_transaction_control(3)* - if applied with *TX_CHAINED*, new transaction
is started. The default is *TX_UNCHAINED* - meaning after commit, control thread
is no more in global transaction.

- *tx_set_commit_return(3)* - if applied with *TX_COMMIT_DECISION_LOGGED* function
returns when first phase of two phase commit is completed (and second phase
is done by background thread). The default is *TX_COMMIT_COMPLETED* meaning
that function returns when commit is completed.

TX API is base on TP API. This function is based on *tpcommit(3)* and it is possible
to mix these two API kinds.

It is forbidden to perform *tx_commit()* having any transactional outstanding calls.
Enduro/X does not explicitly check such calls in progress (direct and/or subsequent 
tpacall, conversational session). If commit is performed in such scenario, 
that might result with orphan active transaction branches, or partial commit 
even having abort-only marking in outstanding call.

RETURN VALUE
------------
On success, *tx_commit()* return *TX_OK*; on error, error code is returned

ERRORS
------

*TX_NO_BEGIN* The transaction committed successfully; however, a new 
transaction could not be started and the caller is no longer in transaction mode. 
This return value occurs only when the transaction_control characteristic is *TX_CHAINED*.

*TX_ROLLBACK* The transaction could not commit and has been rolled back. 
In addition, if the *transaction_control(3)* characteristic is *TX_CHAINED*, 
a new transaction is started.

*TX_ROLLBACK_NO_BEGIN* The transaction could not commit and has been rolled back. 
In addition, a new transaction could not be started and the caller is no longer 
in transaction mode. This return value can occur only when the 
*transaction_control(3)* characteristic is *TX_CHAINED*.

*TX_MIXED* The transaction was partially committed and partially rolled back. 
In addition, if the *transaction_control(3)* characteristic is *TX_CHAINED*, 
a new transaction is started.

*TX_MIXED_NO_BEGIN* The transaction was partially committed and partially 
rolled back. In addition, a new transaction could not be started and the caller 
is no longer in transaction mode. This return value can occur only when the 
*transaction_control(3)* characteristic is *TX_CHAINED*.

*TX_HAZARD* Due to a failure, the transaction may have been partially 
committed and partially rolled back. In addition, if the *transaction_control(3)*
 characteristic is *TX_CHAINED*, a new transaction is started.

*TX_HAZARD_NO_BEGIN* Due to a failure, the transaction may have been partially 
committed and partially rolled back. In addition, a new transaction could 
not be started and the caller is no longer in transaction mode. This return 
value can occur only when the *transaction_control(3)* characteristic 
is *TX_CHAINED*.

*TX_PROTOCOL_ERROR* The function was called in an improper context 
(for example, the caller is not in transaction mode). The caller’s state 
with respect to the transaction is not changed.

*TX_FAIL* Either the transaction manager or one or more of the 
resource managers encountered a fatal error. The nature of the error is 
such that the transaction manager and/or one or more of the resource managers 
can no longer perform work on behalf of the application. The exact
nature of the error can be checked in process and/or transaction manager
log files.
