NAME
----
tpsuspend - Suspend global transaction, and disassociate current thread from XA transaction


SYNOPSIS
--------
#include <atmi.h>

int tpsuspend (TPTRANID *'tranid', long 'flags');

For XATMI client link with '-latmiclt -latmi -lubf -lnstd -lpthread -lrt -lm'

For XATMI server link with '-latmisrv|-latmisrvnomain|-latmisrvinteg -latmi -lubf -lnstd -lpthread -lrt -lm'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Disassociate XA transaction from current thread and store transaction details 
to 'tranid' variable. The transaction can be resumed as by doing *tpresume(3)*. 
*tranid* must not be NULL. 'flags' are reserved for future use, and currently must
 be set to 0. It is error to have any open call descriptors (either by *tpacall(3)* 
or by *tpconnect(3)*). Suspending can be done by any involved process in transaction. 
But the role of participant does not change. The *TPTRANID* type 
records the information about caller, is it transaction originator or not.


*Valid flags*

*TPTXNOOPTIM* Do not use cached known resource managers in 'tranid'. Thus having
this flag set, this process even for previously involved RMs will perform 
xa transaction start and if that fails, then attempt *TM_JOIN*.

*TPTXTMSUSPEND* Transaction shall be suspended with *TMSUSPEND* 
flag instead of *TMSUCCESS*. If this flag is used, then 'tranid' shall not be
used in other thread/process that this particular which performed suspend. The
benefit for this flag is that certain XA resources might allow to resume operations
on cursors, etc. . This applies to XA switches which support join operation (
i.e. is not disabled by *NOJOIN* or *NOSUSPEND* in *NDRX_XA_FLAGS*).

RETURN VALUE
------------
On success, *tpsuspend()* return zero; on error, -1 is returned, 
with *tperrno* set to indicate the error.


ERRORS
------
Note that *tpstrerror()* returns generic error message plus custom message 
with debug info from last function call.

*TPEINVAL* flags was not 0. Or 'tranid' was NULL.

*TPEPROTO* XA subsystem was not initialized (did not call *tpopen()*), global 
transaction was not already started, or there was open call descriptors.

*TPESYSTEM* System failure occurred during serving. See logs i.e. user log, 
or debugs for more info.

*TPEOS* System failure occurred during serving. See logs i.e. user log, 
or debugs for more info.
