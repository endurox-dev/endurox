NAME
----
tpsuspend - Suspend global transaction, and disassociate current thread from XA transaction


SYNOPSIS
--------
#include <atmi.h>

int tpsuspend (TPTRANID *'tranid', long 'flags');

For XATMI client link with '-latmiclt -latmi -lubf -lnstd -lpthread -lrt -lm'

For XATMI server link with '-latmisrv|-latmisrvnomain|-latmisrvinteg -latmi -lubf -lnstd -lpthread -lrt -lm'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Disassociate XA transaction from current thread and store transaction details to 'tranid' variable. The transaction can be resumed as by doing *tpresume()*. *tranid* must not be NULL. 'flags' are reserved for future use, and currently must be set to 0. It is error to have any open call descriptors (either by *tpacall()* or by *tpconnect()*). Suspending can be done by any involved process in transaction. But the role of participant does not change. The *TPTRANID* type records the information about caller, is it transaction originator or not.


RETURN VALUE
------------
On success, *tpsuspend()* return zero; on error, -1 is returned, with *tperrno* set to indicate the error.


ERRORS
------
Note that *tpstrerror()* returns generic error message plus custom message with debug info from last function call.

*TPEINVAL* flags was not 0. Or 'tranid' was NULL.

*TPEPROTO* XA subsystem was not initialized (did not call *tpopen()*), global transaction was not already started, or there was open call descriptors.

*TPESYSTEM* System failure occurred during serving. See logs i.e. user log, or debugs for more info.

*TPEOS* System failure occurred during serving. See logs i.e. user log, or debugs for more info.
