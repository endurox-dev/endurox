NAME
----
tpbroadcast - Broadcast unsolicited messages to matched XATMI clients


SYNOPSIS
--------
#include <atmi.h>

int tpbroadcast(char *'lmid', char *'usrname', char *'cltname', char *'data', 
	long 'len', long 'flags');


For XATMI client link with '-latmiclt -latmi -lubf -lnstd -lpthread -lrt -lm'

For XATMI server link with '-latmisrv|-latmisrvnomain|-latmisrvinteg -latmi 
-lubf -lnstd -lpthread -lrt -lm'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Function is used for sending unsolicited message to multiple clients at once. 
The target clients can be matched by following options:

- 'lmid' Cluster node id to send the message to. If field is set to empty string 
(first byte 0x00) then any cluster node id is matched. If string value is given
then numeric value is expected and is matched against the connected cluster nodes.
Either local or remote. This field can be set to regular expression, 
in that case 'flags' should contain the 'TPREGEXMATCH'. Maximum
statement length is *MAXTIDENT**2-1.

- 'usrname' is reserved for future use. Currently not supported.

- 'cltname' is process name (executable name) that should be matched. If 'cltname'
is NULL or empty string, then it is matched. If string is given then exact executable
is matched for delivery. If binary runs in multiple copies, all of them will
receive notification. The field can be set to regular expression, in that case
flags must contain 'TPREGEXMATCH'. The max length of 'cltname' string can be 
*MAXTIDENT**2-1.


Any combination is possible between 'lmid' and 'cltname'. Any matched process that
will fulfill the matching requirements will receive the message.

The data sent in broadcast is set in variable 'data' which is XATMI
buffer allocated by *tpalloc(3)* (or auto buffer). The complementary 'len' is
used only for buffer types which do not contain length descriptor internally (i.e.
*CARRAY* buffer type).

The 'data' field can be NULL. In this situation matched client callbacks will be called,
but no data will be sent to client. 

In case when 'lmid' is matched on another node, then full broadcast request with
all parameters are sent to remote machines '@TPBROADNNN' service (advertised by 
*tpbrdcstsv(8)*). When dispatched, the remote '@TPBROADNNN' will process the local
matchings of the clients processes and will do the broadcast locally.

*Valid flags*

*TPNOBLOCK* Do not block on full client queue, instead return error.

*TPNOTIME* Do not timeout when waiting on full queue (*TPNOBLOCK* is not set).

*TPSIGRSTRT* Restart the system call in progress if interrupted by signal handler.
This affects only underlaying mq_* function calls.

*TPREGEXMATCH*  Match 'lmid' (cluster node id) and 'cltname' by assuming that
these are regular expressions.


RETURN VALUE
------------
On success, *tpbroadcast()* return zero; on error, -1 is returned, with *tperrno* 
set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
------
Note that *tpstrerror()* returns generic error message plus custom message with 
debug info from last function call. Note that Enduro/X does not analyze the errors
returned by each individual delivery to the client process, thus the function will
try to delivery to all of the clients the notification. If some of them were 
exited or for example client reply (delivery) queue was full and *TPNOBLOCK*
was set or *TPNOTIME* was not set, then error is logged to Enduro/X 'ndrx' logger
and ULOG, but *tpbroadcast(3)* will return success.

*TPEINVAL* Environment variables not configured, see *ex_env(5)* page, or invalid
parameters have been passed to the function, for example 'clientid', 'lmtid' or 
'username' are set and they are invalid regular expressions (i.e. with *TPREGEXMATCH*
set).

*TPESYSTEM* System failure occurred during serving. See logs i.e. user log, 
or debugs for more info.

*TPEOS* System failure occurred during serving. See logs i.e. user log, 
or debugs for more info.
