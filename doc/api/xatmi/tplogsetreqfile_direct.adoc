:doctype: manpage


NAME
----
tplogsetreqfile_direct - Set request file, directly to TLS


SYNOPSIS
--------
#include <ndebug.h>
#include <nerror.h>

void tplogsetreqfile_direct(char *'filename');


Link with '-lnstd -lpthread -lrt -lm'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Function opens *LOG_FACILITY_TP_REQUEST*, *LOG_FACILITY_NDRX_REQUEST* 
and *LOG_FACILITY_UBF_REQUEST* facility for logging. The logging 
is performed to specified 'filename' file. If it fails to set the log file, 
the logger will write the logs to *stderr*. No error is returned.

Special care shall be taken when working in multi-threaded environment (this
includes single thread apps running built in Enduro/X 'emq', 'poll' and 'SystemV'
modes where auxiliary threads are used. In mulit-threaded mode, the output
file name shall differ for process logging file name. Otherwise the output file
pointer is re-used from process logger. Thus If other thread changes process
loggers, this process request logger file pointer might become broken (and
thus cause segmentation faults). See more on thread safety section in *tplogconfig(3)*.

RETURN VALUE
------------
N/A
