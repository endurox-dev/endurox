NAME
----
tpconnect - Connect to conversational service


SYNOPSIS
--------
#include <atmi.h>

int tpconnect(char *svc, char *data, long len, long flags);


For XATMI client link with '-latmiclt -latmi -lubf -lnstd -lpthread -lrt -lm'

For XATMI server link with '-latmisrv|-latmisrvnomain|-latmisrvinteg -latmi -lubf -lnstd -lpthread -lrt -lm'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Connect to conversational service. This is first step to enter in two way streamed communications between caller client and server. The service is given in 'svc' parameter. Destination service must be programmed that way, that it supports conversations. 'data' is optional data buffer that must be allocated by *tpcalloc()*, and the 'len' parameter is used only in case if 'data' is not NULL and buffer is not self describing the length, i.e. *CARRAY*.

*Valid flags*

*TPNOTRAN* Do not call service in transaction mode. This is effective in case if caller process is running in transaction mode, but destination process shall not run in the same global transaction.

*TPSIGRSTRT* Restart the system call in progress if interrupted by signal handler. This affects only underlaying mq_* function calls.

*TPNOTIME* Ignore timeout setting (*NDRX_TOUT* env variable). Wait for reply for infinitely. Global transaction time-out still applies.

*TPTRANSUSPEND* Suspend the current transaction in progress and continue it with destination process. This is suitable in cases when *XA* adapter does not allow multiple processes/sessions to have active same transaction in the same transaction branch. 

*TPSENDONLY* At the call point, caller want's to enter in send only mode.

*TPRECVONLY*  At the call point, caller want's to ender in receive only mode. *TPSENDONLY* and *TPRECVONLY* are each other exclusive and cannot be combined.

RETURN VALUE
------------
On success, *tpconnect()* return connection descriptor (>0); on error, -1 is returned, with *tperrno* set to indicate the error.


ERRORS
------
Note that *tpstrerror()* returns generic error message plus custom message with debug info from last function call.

*TPEINVAL* Invalid parameter is given to function. Either service name is NULL or 'data' is not NULL, but not allocated by *tpalloc()*

*TPENOENT* No service ('svc' parameter) advertised in system.

*TPELIMIT* Max number of connections are reached. Currently max number of connections is limited to 5 (*MAX_CONNECTIONS* macro).

*TPETIME* Service did not reply in given time ('NDRX_TOUT'). 

*TPESVCFAIL* Service returned 'TPFAIL'. This is application level failure.

*TPESVCERR* System level service failure. Server died during the message presence in service queue.

*TPESYSTEM* System failure occurred during serving. See logs i.e. user log, or debugs for more info.

*TPEOS* System failure occurred during serving. See logs i.e. user log, or debugs for more info.
