NAME
----
tpalloc - Allocate XATMI buffer


SYNOPSIS
--------
#include <atmi.h>

char *tpalloc(char *'type', char *'subtype', long 'size');


For XATMI client link with '-latmiclt -latmi -lubf -lnstd -lpthread -lrt -lm'

For XATMI server link with '-latmisrv|-latmisrvnomain|-latmisrvinteg -latmi 
-lubf -lnstd -lpthread -lrt -lm'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Function allocates XATMI buffer by given 'type' and 'subtype'. The buffer size 
is indicated by 'size' argument, if it set to 0 and buffer type is 'UBF', then 
system allocates 1024 for new buffer. Currently subtype is not used, and it can 
be leaved NULL or empty string. If function succeeds, then Enduro/X registers 
buffer in internal registry. If user allocates the buffer, it is up to user to 
free it with *tpfree()*, only exception is with auto buffers which are allocated 
at point when when service receives request, and Enduro/X will free the buffer 
after doing *tpreturn()* or *tpforward()*.

*Valid type*

*UBF* Unified Buffer Format. Which is type key-value storage with extensive API. 
See *ubf.h* for list of functions.

*UBF32* The same as *UBF*.

*FML* Compatibility mode with Tuxedo. Same as *UBF*.

*FML32* Compatibility mode with Tuxedo. Same as *UBF*.

*STRING* String buffer. It can store any ASCII character except 0x00, which will 
indicate the end of the data i.e. zero terminated string.

*JSON* This is also string format, can hold ASCII chars, 0x00 is used for string 
termination. The difference between this format and *STRING*, is that JSON 
buffer can be used for converting it automatically to *UBF* and vice versa, 
either by service request or by issuing *tpjsontoubf()*, *tpubftojson()*.

*CARRAY* Byte array buffer. Can hold 0x00 byte.

*VIEW* This is view buffer, see *viewfile(5)* for view descriptor format. Basically
with view the C structure is being defined (generated) which included in the code
by header file. For *VIEW* buffer 'subtype' must be specified. The views must be
configured by setting up 'VIEWDIR' and 'VIEWFILES' environment variables.
'VIEWFILES' must contain the list of compiled 'object-files'. If attempt to allocate
view that is not defined or the environment is not configured, *tpalloc* will
return *TPENOENT* error. When allocating the view, the size must be specified
how much space shall be allocated. How ever, it must not be less that 
sizeof(<generated view struct>). If size is less than 1024, then 1024 bytes are
allocated. If 1024 or given size is less than structure size, then warning is
printed in ULOG. If size is smaller than struct size, then any operations with
structure (like *tpcall(3)* or *Bvstof(3)*) can cause segmentation fault.

RETURN VALUE
------------
On success, *tpalloc()* return zero; on error, -1 is returned, with *tperrno* set 
to indicate the error.


ERRORS
------
Note that *tpstrerror()* returns generic error message plus custom message with 
debug info from last function call.

*TPEINVAL* Invalid type parameters are given to function, possibly NULL. This 
error also can be generated in case if the environment is not configured for 
Enduro/X properly.

*TPEOTYPE* Invalid type specified to function.

*TPESYSTEM* System failure occurred during serving. See logs i.e. user log, or 
debugs for more info.

*TPEOS* System failure occurred during serving. See logs i.e. user log, or 
debugs for more info. In case of insufficient memory this error will be 
generated too.

*TPEOTYPE* VIEW sub-type not found or environment is not configured.
