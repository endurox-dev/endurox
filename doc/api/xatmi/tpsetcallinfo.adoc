NAME
----
tpsetcallinfo - Set call headers for the primary data buffer


SYNOPSIS
--------
#include <atmi.h>

int tpsetcallinfo(const char *'msg', UBFH *'cibuf', long flags)

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Function is used to associate UBF format based meta data storage buffer in present
in variable 'cibuf' to the main XATMI buffer given in 'msg' field. 'msg' buffer
must be allocated with *tpalloc(3)*.

When using the 'msg' buffer for calling services, the associated call info buffer
will be transported to other processes too. Deallocation of associated meta
data is performed in the same time when 'msg' buffer is freed.

'cibuf' may be used for purposes like storing header data (like headers for HTTP
protocol) or other call relevant data, which shall travel with original call
through the system (i.e. *tpcall(3)*, *tpacall(3)*, *tpconnect(3)*, *tpforward(3)*, 
*tpnotify(3)*, *tpbroadcast(3)*, *tpsent(3)*, *tprecv(3)*, *tpenqueue(3)*, *tpdequeue(3)*,
*tpgetrply(3)*).

'flags' parameter is reserved for future use and shall be set to *0*.

For *NULL* buffers ('msg' is *NULL*), call info cannot be set.

When receiving data which has the call infos over the XATMI buffer for which 
also have the call info associated (for example *tpgetrply(3)* call), the existing
call info are replaced with received call info. If receiving data has not call
info, the existing association continues to exist.

When  using smart cache, the call info data not cached.

RETURN VALUE
------------
On success, *tpsetcallinfo()* return zero; on error, -1 is returned, with 
*tperrno* set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
------
Note that *tpstrerror()* returns generic error message plus custom message with 
debug info from last function call.

*TPEINVAL* 'cibuf' is not UBF format. Flags is not *0*. 'msg' is NULL. 'msg'
does not point to XATMI allocated buffer.

*TPEOS* Failed to malloc or System failure occurred during serving. 
See logs i.e. user log, or debugs for more info.
