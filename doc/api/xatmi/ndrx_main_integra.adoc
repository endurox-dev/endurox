NDRX_MAIN_INTEGRA(3)
====================
:doctype: manpage


NAME
----
ndrx_main_integra - run the XATMI servers main loop, integration mode


SYNOPSIS
--------
#include <atmi.h>

int ndrx_main_integra(int 'argc', char \*\*'argv', int (\*'in_tpsvrinit')(int, char \*\*),
            void (*'in_tpsvrdone')(void), long 'flags');

Link with '-latmisrv|-latmisrvnomain|-latmisrvinteg -latmi -lubf -lnstd -lpthread -lrt -lm'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Function is used in case if Enduro/X XATMI server is linked with 
'-latmisrvinteg' library. In this case binarie's *main()* function resists 
outside of Enduro/X libs, thus to launch the XATMI server, the 
*ndrx_main_integra()* needs to be called. The full 'argc' and 'argv' of 
binary's command line must be passed to this function. In integration mode, 
callbacks for *tpsvrinit(3)* and *tpsvrdone(3)* must be passed in.

*Valid flags*

*ATMI_SRVLIB_NOLONGJUMP* do not do long jump when *tpreturn(3)* or 
*tpforward(3)* returns. This is suitable for systems for which long jump can 
crash runtime internals. But not that in this case *tpreturn()* and 
*tpforward()* will return as normal function call. Thus programmer shall ensure 
that proper logic. It is expected that these are last functions called 
in XATMI server's service.

This function is available only for XATMI servers.

RETURN VALUE
------------
On success, *ndrx_main_integra()* return zero; on error, -1 is returned, 
with *tperrno* set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
------
Note that *tpstrerror()* for returns generic error message plus custom 
message with debug info from last call.

*TPESYSTEM* System failure occurred during serving. See logs i.e. user log, 
or debugs for more info.

*TPEOS* System failure occurred during serving. See logs i.e. user log, 
or debugs for more info.

Other error might be emitted too.
