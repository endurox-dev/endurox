NAME
----
tpfree - Free up XATMI buffer


SYNOPSIS
--------
#include <atmi.h>

void tpfree(char *'ptr');


For XATMI client link with '-latmiclt -latmi -lubf -lnstd -lpthread -lrt -lm'

For XATMI server link with '-latmisrv|-latmisrvnomain|-latmisrvinteg -latmi -lubf 
-lnstd -lpthread -lrt -lm'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Free up the XATMI buffer allocated by *tpalloc()* or *tprealloc()*. The pointer 
shall not be used to any other calls afterwards, as it points to invalid memory 
after call. *tpfree()* must not be used for auto-allocated buffers, i.e. ones 
received into to service routine, as auto buffers will be cleaned up in following 
*tpreturn()* or *tpforward()* calls.

Function will not free any other resources e.g. allocated by *malloc()* or *calloc()*.

*tpfree()* is not needed to be called on buffers which are automatically allocated
by incoming service call. Also *tpfree()* is not needed to called on buffers
which are returned to *tpreturn(3)* or *tpforward(3)*. At service ending,
tpreturn or tpforward makes free auto-allocated buffer and return buffer (if it
is different than auto-alloc buffer).

RETURN VALUE
------------
Function is void and no error is returned.

ERRORS
------
Function is void and no error is returned.

EXAMPLE
-------
