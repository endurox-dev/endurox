NAME
----
tpcall - Call XATMI service


SYNOPSIS
--------
#include <atmi.h>

int tpacall(char \*'svc', char \*'idata', long 'ilen', char **'odata', long *'olen', long 'flags');


For XATMI client link with '-latmiclt -latmi -lubf -lnstd -lpthread -lrt -lm'

For XATMI server link with '-latmisrv|-latmisrvnomain|-latmisrvinteg -latmi -lubf -lnstd -lpthread -lrt -lm'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Call the XATMI service by given 'svc' name. The 'idata' is optional input XATMI 
buffer. If it is not a NULL, then it must be allocated with *tpcalloc()* call, 
'ilen' is used for buffer types such *CARRAY*, where buffer length is not 
described by type. When caller receives response, it is stored in 'odata' 
buffer which must be also allocated by *tpcalloc()*. If the allocated buffer 
size is shorter then received one, then Enduro/X will automatically realloc the 
buffer to new size. 'olen' is mandatory field, where the received buffer length 
is stored. If *TPNOTRAN* is not specified and current process is in global 
transaction, then system will make destination process run in 
same destination process.

*Valid flags*

*TPNOTRAN* Do not call service in transaction mode. This is effective in 
case if caller process is running in transaction mode, but destination process 
shall not run in the same global transaction

*TPSIGRSTRT* Restart the system call in progress if interrupted by signal 
handler. This affects only underlaying mq_* function calls.

*TPNOTIME* Ignore timeout setting (*NDRX_TOUT* env variable). 
Wait for reply for infinitely.

*TPNOCHANGE* Do not allow to change the reply buffer type. If flag 
is set and different buffer type is received than original, 
then error *TPEINVAL* is returned.

*TPTRANSUSPEND* Suspend the current transaction in progress and continue it 
with destination process. This is suitable in cases when *XA* adapter does not 
allow multiple processes/sessions to have active same transaction 
in the same transaction branch.

*TPNOBLOCK* In case of target service request queue is full, do not wait on queue, but
return error. The error code for this situation is *TPEBLOCK*. This affects only
request part of the call. This flag does not affect waiting for response from server.

RETURN VALUE
------------ 
set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
------
Note that *tpstrerror()* returns generic error message plus custom message with 
debug info from last function call.

*TPEINVAL* Invalid parameter is given to function. Either service name is NULL 
or flags does not allow to change the value.

*TPENOENT* No service ('svc' parameter) advertised in system.

*TPETIME* Service did not reply in given time ('NDRX_TOUT'). 

*TPESVCFAIL* Service returned 'TPFAIL'. This is application level failure.

*TPESVCERR* System level service failure. Server died during the message presence in service queue.

*TPESYSTEM* System failure occurred during serving. See logs i.e. user log, or debugs for more info.

*TPEOS* System failure occurred during serving. See logs i.e. user log, or debugs for more info.

*TPEBLOCK* Service request queue was full and *TPNOBLOCK* flag was specified.
