NAME
----
tpsvrthrinit - Template and default version for server dispatch thread init function


SYNOPSIS
--------
#include <atmi.h>

int tpsvrthrinit (int 'argc', char **'argv');

For XATMI server link with '-latmisrvinteg -latmi -lubf -lnstd -lpthread -lrt -lm'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This function is called upon XATMI server process starting up. Function is invoked
for XATMI servers which are configured to work in multi-threaded mode.

The 'argc' and 'argv' is command line parameters  passed to binary after the '--'. 
Initial parameters are used by Enduro/X, these are sys-opts in the *ndrxconfig.xml*, 
after the '--' those are application specific options.

Normally at *tpsvrthrinit()* is used for threads to perform the initialization.
In multi-threaded mode, the worker threads actually are clients for which *tpinit()*
is done previously by Enduro/X.

The default version of this function is provided by Enduro/X which is built in
in the the *-latmisrvinteg* library. Default version of the function invokes
*tx_open()*. If *tx_open()* fails, the service process will abort the startup.

The *tpsvrthrinit()* is activated only

. if XATMI server is built by *builserver(8)* having flag *-t* set.

. Or XATMI server process is started by *_tmstartserver(3)* with extern variable 
*_tmbuilt_with_thread_option* is set to *1*. And function name is specified in 
*tmsvrargs_t* structure for the *p_tpsvrthrinit* field.

In case if program is single threaded and default *tpsrvinit(3)* is used. Where
default *tpsrvinit()* will invoke the *tpsvrthrinit()*.

To start program as multi-threaded *ndrxconfig.xml(5)* in server section 
*<mindispatchthreads>* and *<maxdispatchthreads>* must be greater than 1.


This only applies to XATMI servers.

RETURN VALUE
------------
If application failed to initialize, the user shall return non 0 value. 
If succeed, then 0 must be returned.

ERRORS
------
Not available.
