NAME
----
tplogclosereqfile - Close the current request logging facility


SYNOPSIS
--------
#include <ndebug.h>

void tplogclosereqfile(void);

Link with '-lnstd -lpthread -lrt -lm'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Close currently open request logging facility. It is not a problem to call 
a function twice. If request logger is closed nothing will happen. With this 
function logger will be degraded to thread logging facility (if was open) or 
to process based logging.

Function applies to all Enduro/X logging facilities: *TP*, *NDRX* and *UBF*,
thus when request logging is closed, any facility is degraded thread or process
logging.


RETURN VALUE
------------
N/A

ERRORS
------
N/A

EXAMPLE
-------
See *atmitest/test031_logging/atmiclt31.c* for sample code.
