NAME
----
tpchkunsol - Process received unsolicited messages

SYNOPSIS
--------
#include <atmi.h>

int tpchkunsol(void);

For XATMI client link with '-latmiclt -latmi -lubf -lnstd -lpthread -lrt -lm'

For XATMI server link with '-latmisrv|-latmisrvnomain|-latmisrvinteg -latmi 
-lubf -lnstd -lpthread -lrt -lm'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Function is used for receiving and dispatching unsolicited messages 
(published by *tpnotify(3)* or *tpbroadcast(3)*) to client processes 
in case if client process is not doing in-progress *tpcall(3)* or *tpgetrply(3)*.

From software architecture standpoint, the XATMI client reply queue is shared
between normal tpcall/tpacall replies and notifications.

*tpchkunsol()* checks for priority 1 messages (notification/broadcast) 
in client reply queue. If such message is found, 
then callback set by *tpsetunsol(3)* is invoked. If *tpacall(3)*
reply message is received instead of notification, the call reply message is saved
in in-process memory linked list which serves internally as a 'queue'. Thus
the next *tpacall(3)* invocation will return to user process message from linked
list instead of the POSIX queue. The programmer must take this in account, because
if there will be lots of *tpacall(3)* invocation and few *tpgetrply(3)*,
then process memory will grow with unprocessed replies. 
Thus it is recommended when using unsolicited messaging, periodically invoke 
the *tpgetrply(3)*.

Note when doing *tpcall(3)* or *tpgetrply(3)*, these functions
in case of receiving unsolicited message, will dispatch notifications automatically.
Thus there is no need for *tpchkunsol(3)* invocation during this time.


RETURN VALUE
------------
On success, *tpchkunsol()* returns number of notifications processed; 
on error, -1 is returned, with *tperrno* set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
------
Note that *tpstrerror()* returns generic error message plus custom message with 
debug info from last function call.

*TPESYSTEM* System failure occurred during serving. See logs i.e. user log, 
or debugs for more info.

*TPEOS* System failure occurred during serving. See logs i.e. user log, 
or debugs for more info.
