DESCRIPTION
-----------
Function is used to retrieve any call header information associated with 'msg'
XATMI buffer. Both buffers 'msg' and 'cibuf' must be allocated by *tpalloc(3)*
calls. The 'msg' cannot be NULL buffer (null). 'cibuf' most point to XATMI buffer
or *NULL*. Once function called, any call infos are copied to 'cibuf' (with
type reallocation, if there is not enough space in 'cibuf' or not a UBF buffer).

'flags' is reserved for future use, and shall be set to *0*.

Call information to XATMI buffer is set by *tpsetcallinfo(3)* call, and is associated
with 'msg' buffer through the call path, i.e. IPC between processes, such as
*tpcall(3)*. For more details see *tpsetcallinfo(3)* description.

RETURN VALUE
------------
On success, *tpgetcallinfo()* return zero; on error, -1 is returned, with 
*tperrno* set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
------
Note that *tpstrerror()* returns generic error message plus custom message with 
debug info from last function call.

*TPEINVAL* 'msg' is NULL, 'msg' is not XATMI buffer, flags is not *0*. 'cibuf'
is NULL or not pointing to valid XATMI buffer.

*TPESYSTEM* No call infos are associated with 'msg' buffer.

*TPEOS* System failure occurred during serving. See logs i.e. user log, or debugs for more info.
Also used in cases in case of memory condition.
