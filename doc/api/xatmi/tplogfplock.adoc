tplogfplock - Lock log file FILE pointer


SYNOPSIS
--------
#include <ndebug.h>

ndrx_debug_t * tplogfplock(int 'lev', long 'flags');

Link with '-lnstd -lpthread -lrt -lm'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Function locks the current FILE pointer for *tp* logging topic. When lock is acquired,
any log rotate or log file changing manipulations by other threads would be delayed.

This function typically must be called prior reading getting the FILE pointer by
*tplogfpget(3)* function. The locked file pointer shall be released by *tplogfpunlock(3)*
after it is no more in use.

'lev' argument shall be set to log level planning to write the data to FILE pointer.
If current log level is lower then 'lev' set, function returns *NULL*, meaning it is not
locked and no logging needed. However if no log level check is needed, the 'lev' argument
shall be passed as *-1*.

'flags' is reserved for future use.

RETURN VALUE
------------
Pointer to debug descriptor or *NULL* if no logging is required.

ERRORS
------
N/A
