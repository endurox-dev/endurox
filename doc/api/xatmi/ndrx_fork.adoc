NDRX_FORK(3)
============
:doctype: manpage


NAME
----
ndrx_fork - Fork the Enduro/X client or server


SYNOPSIS
--------
#include <atmi.h>

pid_t ndrx_fork(void);

For XATMI client link with '-latmiclt -latmi -lubf -lnstd -lpthread -lrt -lm'

For XATMI server link with '-latmisrv|-latmisrvnomain|-latmisrvinteg -latmi -lubf -lnstd -lpthread -lrt -lm'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
When doing forking with the XATMI binaries (either clients or servers), the special
care shall be taken when process is about to copy it self. In case if XATMI
server process want's to copy it self, the child copy shall close any queues and
other resources used by parent's XATMI server. Thus one of the tasks of 
*ndrx_fork()* is to close server resources after the forking the XATMI servers.

In standard situation when client process is about to fork, it should perform 
*tpterm(3)* then perform *ndrx_fork(3)* and do *tpinit(3)* back on either in
parent or child or both. In this scenario standard *fork(3)* can be used too,
if System V queues are not used.

In case if for IPC transport System V queues are used, *ndrx_fork()* is mandatory
to be used by both XATMI clients and servers, because System V uses auxiliary
threads to support real time operations, thus before forking threads must be
terminated, and the restored properly back for the parent process (child performs
fresh init back on if XATMI IPC operations are used).

If developer cannot replace designed *fork()* with *ndrx_fork()* (i.e. it is used
in library), then developer may use:

. *ndrx_atfork_prepare(3)* - parent calls before forking

. *ndrx_atfork_parent(3)* - called by parent after forking

. *ndrx_atfork_child(3)* - called by child after forking

functions and either call them manually after the fork or register them with
*pthread_atfork()* function which automatically invokes them in proper order
when fork() call is performed.



RETURN VALUE
------------ 
On success, *ndrx_fork()* returns 0 for child process, and pid (>0) for the parent
process. In case of failure -1 is returned.


ERRORS
------
See *fork()* system calls errors.

-------
