NAME

tprecv - Receive message from open conversation


SYNOPSIS
--------
#include <atmi.h>

int tprecv(int 'cd', char **'data', long *'len', long 'flags', long *'revent');


DESCRIPTION
-----------
Receive message from open conversation, which is opened by *tpconnect()*. The incoming  buffer 'data' must be allocated with *tpalloc()*. If conversation receives disconnect (*TPEV_DISCONIMM*), service error (*TPEV_SVCERR*) or service failure (*TPEV_SVCFAIL*), then global transaction if one in progress is aborted.

*Valid flags*

*TPSIGRSTRT* Restart the system call in progress if interrupted by signal handler. This affects only underlying mq_* function calls.

*TPNOTIME* Ignore timeout setting (*NDRX_TOUT* env variable). Wait for reply for infinitely.

*TPNOBLOCK* Do not block on empty queue, if not messages present, the function returns immediately.

RETURN VALUE
------------
On success, *tpcall()* return zero; on error, -1 is returned, with *tperrno* set to indicate the error.

*'revent' return values*

*TPEV_DISCONIMM* Disconnect received from other conversation end, by issuing *tpdiscon()*. The global transaction in progress is aborted in this case.

*TPEV_SENDONLY* The sender program issued *tpsend()* with flag *TPEV_SENDONLY*, meaning that we become senders.

*TPEV_SVCERR* Server died and queue was removed.

*TPEV_SVCFAIL* Server returned *TPFAIL* with *tpreturn()*

*TPEV_SVCSUCC* Server did *tpreturn()* with *TPSUCCESS*.


ERRORS
------
Note that *tpstrerror()* returns generic error message plus custom message with debug info from last function call.

*TPEINVAL* Invalid call descriptor 'cd' passed in.

*TPETIME* Service did not reply in given time ('NDRX_TOUT'). 

*TPEEVENT* Event received and it is installed into 'revent' field.

*TPEPROTO* System level service failure. Server died during the message presence in service queue.

*TPESYSTEM* System failure occurred during serving. See logs i.e. user log, or debugs for more info.

*TPEOS* System failure occurred during serving. See logs i.e. user log, or debugs for more info.
