NAME
----
tpacall - Call XATMI service asynchronously


SYNOPSIS
--------
#include <atmi.h>

int tpacall(char *'svc', char *'data', long 'len', long 'flags');


For XATMI client link with '-latmiclt -latmi -lubf -lnstd -lpthread -lrt -lm'

For XATMI server link with '-latmisrv|-latmisrvnomain|-latmisrvinteg -latmi -lubf -lnstd -lpthread -lrt -lm'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Call the XATMI service by given 'svc' name asynchronously. The 'data' is 
optional input XATMI buffer. If it is not a NULL, then it must be allocated 
with *tpcalloc()* call, 'len' is used for buffer types such *CARRAY*, where 
buffer length is not described by type. If call succeeds, the function return 
the call descriptor. With call descriptor it is possible later to receive the 
response by using *tpgetrply()* If *TPNOTRAN* is not specified and current 
process is in global transaction, then system will make destination process 
run in same global transaction.

tpacall() current does not suspend the global transaction before sending
the data. If such logic is required, the *tpsuspend(3)* shall be used
for this purpose.

*Valid flags*

*TPNOTRAN* Do not call service in transaction mode. This is effective in 
case if caller process is running in transaction mode, but destination 
process shall not run in the same global transaction

*TPSIGRSTRT* Restart the system call in progress if interrupted by 
signal handler. This affects only underlying mq_* function calls.

*TPNOBLOCK* In case of target service queue is full, do not wait on queue, but
return error. The error code for this situation is *TPEBLOCK*.

*TPNOREPLY* Do not expect reply from the call. This works with principle
"send and forget". In this case return value for successful call is *0*.
This flag cannot be used in global transaction mode.

*TPNOTIME* Do not use timeout setting when sending message to queue,
process will wait indefinitely to submit the message to blocking IPC queue.

RETURN VALUE
------------
On success, *tpacall()* return call descriptor (>0); on error, -1 is returned, 
with *tperrno* set to indicate the error.


ERRORS
------
Note that *tpstrerror()* returns generic error message plus custom message 
with debug info from last function call.

*TPEINVAL* Invalid parameter is given to function. Either service name is 
NULL or flags does not allow to change the value. Process is in global
transaction and *TPNOREPLY* flag was specified and *TPNOTRAN* flag was not specified.

*TPENOENT* No service ('svc' parameter) advertised in system.

*TPETIME* Destination service queue was blocking (full) and timeout out
for sending was exceeded (see *NDRX_TOUT* env setting in *ex_env(5)*, *tptoutset(3)* or 
*tpsblktime(3)*). 

*TPESYSTEM* System failure occurred during serving. See logs i.e. user log, 
or debugs for more info. DDR route not found or failed.

*TPEOS* System failure occurred during serving. See logs i.e. user log, 
or debugs for more info.

*TPEBLOCK* Service queue was full and *TPNOBLOCK* flag was specified.

*TPNOTIME* Do not expire call by server process, if message age is older
than 'NDRX_TOUT' timeout (or timeout overridden by *tptoutset(3)*).

-------
