NAME
----
tpacall - Call XATMI service asynchronously


SYNOPSIS
--------
#include <atmi.h>

int tpacall(char *'svc', char *'data', long 'len', long 'flags');


For XATMI client link with '-latmiclt -latmi -lubf -lnstd -lpthread -lrt -lm'

For XATMI server link with '-latmisrv|-latmisrvnomain|-latmisrvinteg -latmi -lubf -lnstd -lpthread -lrt -lm'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Call the XATMI service by given 'svc' name asynchronously. The 'data' is 
optional input XATMI buffer. If it is not a NULL, then it must be allocated 
with *tpcalloc()* call, 'len' is used for buffer types such *CARRAY*, where 
buffer length is not described by type. If call succeeds, the function return 
the call descriptor. With call descriptor it is possible later to receive the 
response by using *tpgetrply()* If *TPNOTRAN* is not specified and current 
process is in global transaction, then system will make destination process 
run in same destination process.

*Valid flags*

*TPNOTRAN* Do not call service in transaction mode. This is effective in 
case if caller process is running in transaction mode, but destination 
process shall not run in the same global transaction

*TPSIGRSTRT* Restart the system call in progress if interrupted by 
signal handler. This affects only underlaying mq_* function calls.

*TPNOBLOCK* In case of target service queue is full, do not wait on queue, but
return error. The error code for this situation is *TPEBLOCK*.

RETURN VALUE
------------
On success, *tpacall()* return call descriptor (>0); on error, -1 is returned, 
with *tperrno* set to indicate the error.


ERRORS
------
Note that *tpstrerror()* returns generic error message plus custom message 
with debug info from last function call.

*TPEINVAL* Invalid parameter is given to function. Either service name is 
NULL or flags does not allow to change the value.

*TPENOENT* No service ('svc' parameter) advertised in system.

*TPETIME* Service did not reply in given time ('NDRX_TOUT'). 

*TPESVCFAIL* Service returned 'TPFAIL'. This is application level failure.

*TPESVCERR* System level service failure. Server died during the message 
presence in service queue.

*TPESYSTEM* System failure occurred during serving. See logs i.e. user log, 
or debugs for more info.

*TPEOS* System failure occurred during serving. See logs i.e. user log, 
or debugs for more info.

*TPEBLOCK* Service queue was full and *TPNOBLOCK* flag was specified.
