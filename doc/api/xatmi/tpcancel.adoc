NAME
----
tpcancel - Cancel the call which was issued by tpacall().


SYNOPSIS
--------
#include <atmi.h>

int tpcancel(int cd);

For XATMI client link with '-latmiclt -latmi -lubf -lnstd -lpthread -lrt -lm'

For XATMI server link with '-latmisrv|-latmisrvnomain|-latmisrvinteg -latmi -lubf -lnstd -lpthread -lrt -lm'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Cancel the asynchronous call done by *tpacall()*. Basically this marks the call descriptor as unused in 
internal call descriptor registry. If answer is received for such descriptor, the answer is discarded. 
Note that this does not abort the transaction (if started) by previous tpacall.
Thus if transaction needs to be aborted, use *tpabort()*.

Prior canceling the call descriptor, function attempts to perform non blocked read of the client reply
queue until the given 'cd' is found or EOF of queue is reached. If other call replies are downloaded
from the queue, they are buffered in processes memory.

RETURN VALUE
------------
On success, *tpacall()* return call descriptor (>0); on error, -1 is returned, 
with *tperrno* set to indicate the error.


ERRORS
------
Note that *tpstrerror()* returns generic error message plus custom message with
debug info from last function call.

*TPEBADDESC* Invalid call descriptor (out of range).

*TPEINVAL* Enduro/X is not configured.

*TPESYSTEM* System failure occurred during serving. See logs i.e. user log, or debugs for more info.

*TPEOS* System failure occurred during serving. See logs i.e. user log, or debugs for more info.
