NAME
----
tpnotify - Send unsolicited message to the client process


SYNOPSIS
--------
#include <atmi.h>

int tpnotify(CLIENTID *'clientid', char *'data', long 'len', long 'flags');


For XATMI client link with '-latmiclt -latmi -lubf -lnstd -lpthread -lrt -lm'

For XATMI server link with '-latmisrv|-latmisrvnomain|-latmisrvinteg -latmi 
-lubf -lnstd -lpthread -lrt -lm'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Function is used for sending unsolicited message to the client. The client is
identified by 'clientid'. The 'clientid' can be acquired by server process, with
incoming service call. The services parameter 'svcinfo' by type *TPSVCINFO* contains
'cltid' field. This can be used as client identifier for sending the notifications
to. Also notifications can be delivered to server processes while it is doing
*tpcall(3)*. The data sent to client is set in variable 'data' which is XATMI
buffer allocated by *tpalloc(3)* (or auto buffer). The complementary 'len' is
used only for buffer types which do not contain length descriptor internally (i.e.
*CARRAY* buffer type).

The 'data' field can be NULL. In this situation client callback will be called,
but no data will be sent to client. In case when client is present on other cluster
node, the message is delivered to bridge process. And on remote machine unsolicited
message dispatching is performed by *tpbrdcstsv(8)*. when dispatching on remote
machine timeout condition is not reported to the caller.

*Valid flags*

*TPNOBLOCK* Do not block on full client queue, instead return error.

*TPNOTIME* Do not timeout when waiting on full queue (*TPNOBLOCK* is not set).

*TPSIGRSTRT* Restart the system call in progress if interrupted by signal handler.
This affects only underlaying mq_* function calls.

*TPACK* Reserved for future use, Enduro/X silently ignores this flag. Thus
*tpnotify()* call does not get any acknowledgement signal that client is processed
the message. This is limitation of Enduro/X.

RETURN VALUE
------------
On success, *tpcall()* return zero; on error, -1 is returned, with *tperrno* 
set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
------
Note that *tpstrerror()* returns generic error message plus custom message with 
debug info from last function call.

*TPEINVAL* Environment variables not configured, see *ex_env(5)* page, or invalid
parameters have been passed to the function, for example 'clientid' is NULL or
corrupted.

*TPENOENT* The local delivery was about to be performed (no remote client call)
and the client process did not exist on local machine. This error will be reported
regardless of the *TPACK* flag.

*TPETIME* Blocking message delivery did timeout. Meaning that client queue was
full and *TPNOBLOCK* nor *TPNOTIME* was set. Error is returned from local clients
only regardless of the *TPACK* flag. If client resists on remote node, then this
error can be returned only when time-out occurred while sending message to then
local bridge server.

*TPEBLOCK* Client queue was full and *TPNOBLOCK* flag was not specified.

*TPESYSTEM* System failure occurred during serving. See logs i.e. user log, 
or debugs for more info.

*TPEOS* System failure occurred during serving. See logs i.e. user log, 
or debugs for more info.
