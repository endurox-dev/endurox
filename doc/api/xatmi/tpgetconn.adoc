NAME
----
tpgetconn - Get XA Driver database/resource connection


SYNOPSIS
--------
#include <atmi.h>

void* tpgetconn(void);

For XATMI client link with '-latmiclt -latmi -lubf -lnstd -lpthread -lrt -lm'

For XATMI server link with '-latmisrv|-latmisrvnomain|-latmisrvinteg -latmi -lubf -lnstd -lpthread -lrt -lm'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Function is used to return XA driver specific connection data. By default this
function without specific XA driver use will return NULL with error set to *TPENOENT*,
as callback for Enduro/X ATMI library is not known.

If callback is installed, the function would return pointer to driver specific
connection handler object. The pointer shall be interpreted according to driver
specification. For example Enduro/X PostgreSQL drivers would return (PGconn *)
pointer.

In case if driver specific callback is installed and driver specific data is *NULL*,
no *tperrno* is set.

RETURN VALUE
------------
On success, *tpgetconn()* executes the XA Driver specific callback for getting
connection object. The result could be pointer or NULL, *tperrno* is set to 0.
In case if callback is not installed, the *tperrno* is set to indicate this.

ERRORS
------
Note that *tpstrerror()* returns generic error message plus custom message 
with debug info from last function call.

*TPENOENT* Callback is not installed by XA driver.

*TPESYSTEM* System failure occurred during serving.
See logs i.e. user log, or debugs for more info.

*TPEOS* System failure occurred during serving.
See logs i.e. user log, or debugs for more info.

*TPENOENT* Callback from XA driver is not installed.
