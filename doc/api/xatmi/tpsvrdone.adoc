NAME
----
tpsvrdone - Template server done function signature


SYNOPSIS
--------
#include <atmi.h>

void tpsvrdone(void);


For XATMI client link with '-latmiclt -latmi -lubf -lnstd -lpthread -lrt -lm'

For XATMI server link with '-latmisrv|-latmisrvnomain|-latmisrvinteg -latmi -lubf -lnstd -lpthread -lrt -lm'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This is XATMI server un-initialization function. It is called when Enduro/X 
application server is being shutdown or when process is being shutdown 
separately by *xadmin stop*. Depending on the version for which *atmisrv* 
library XATMI server is being linked, the form of function that should be 
exported by application changes.

1. If server binary is linked with '-latmisrv', then server must contain 
public (non static) function of *tpsvrdone()*.

2. If server binary is linked with '-latmisrvnomain', then above (1) rule still 
applies. But in this case the caller's *main()* must invoke *ndrx_main()* function.

3. If server binary is linked with '-latmisrvinteg', then functions *tpsvrinit()* 
and tpsvrdone()* must be passed to *ndrx_main_integra()* function.
Or if starting server by *_tmstartserver()* - built by *buildserver(8)*, 
function must pointer must be present in 'tmsvrargs_t'.

During the execution of *tpsvrdone()* the library is still initialized and is 
valid for doing XATMI calls. Normally with this function, then user code 
shall close any XA resource managers open with *tpopen()*

Library 'atmisrvinteg' provides built in version of *tpsvrdone()* function. Function
may be used only if starting server with *_tmstartserver(3)* (or was built by
*buildserver(8)*). The default *tpsvrdone()* function, in case if application was
not built for multi-threading (extern variable '_tmbuilt_with_thread_option' set to 0 
or buildserver '-t' not set), 
calls *tpsvrthrdone(3)* from the 'tmsvrargs_t'.
In case there were no *tpsvrthrdone(3)* provided, the default *tpsvrthrdone()* is
used also from 'atmisrvinteg' library. The default version of *tpsvrthrdone(3)* calls
*tx_close(3)*.

This only applies to XATMI servers.

RETURN VALUE
------------
Not available as function is void.

ERRORS
------
Not available.
