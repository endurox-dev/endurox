NAME
----
tpsvrdone - Template server done tunction signature


SYNOPSIS
--------
#include <atmi.h>

void tpsvrdone(void);


For XATMI client link with '-latmiclt -latmi -lubf -lnstd -lpthread -lrt -lm'

For XATMI server link with '-latmisrv|-latmisrvnomain|-latmisrvinteg -latmi -lubf -lnstd -lpthread -lrt -lm'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This is XATMI server un-initialization function. It is called when Enduro/X application server is being shutdown or when process is being shutdown separately by *xadmin stop*. Depending on the version for which *atmisrv* library XATMI server is being linked, the form of function that should be exported by application changes.

1. If server binary is linked with '-latmisrv', then server must contain public (non static) function of *tpsvrdone()*.

2. If server binary is linked with '-latmisrvnomain', then above (1) rule still applies. But in this case the caller's *main()* must invoke *ndrx_main()* function.

3. If server binary is linked with '-latmisrvinteg', then functions *tpsvrinit()* and tpsvrdone()* must be passed to *ndrx_main_integra()* function.

During the execution of *tpsvrdone()* the library is still initialised and is valid for doing XATMI calls. Normally with this function, then user code shall close any XA resource managers open with *tpopen()*

This only applies to XATMI servers.

RETURN VALUE
------------
Not available as function is void.

ERRORS
------
Not available.
