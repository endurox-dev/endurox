NAME
----
tpcommit - Commit global transaction in progress


SYNOPSIS
--------
#include <atmi.h>

int tpcommit (long 'flags');

For XATMI client link with '-latmiclt -latmi -lubf -lnstd -lpthread -lrt -lm'

For XATMI server link with '-latmisrv|-latmisrvnomain|-latmisrvinteg -latmi -lubf -lnstd -lpthread -lrt -lm'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Function does commit the global transaction. Transaction must not be marked as 
abort only (e.g. in case if *tpcall()* failed). After issuing the command, 
*tmsrv(8)* will do the commit procedure, prepare phase first, log the 
results of prepare to persistent storage, and then do the actual commit.

*Valid flags*

*TPTXCOMMITDLOG* If set, tpcommit will return when decision for commit is logged
(i.e. first phase of 2 phase commit is done - resource managers are in prepared
state). Thus transaction will be completed by *tmsrv* background thread, which
runs periodically by *-s* (command line argument) seconds.

RETURN VALUE
------------
On success, *tpcommit()* return zero; on error, -1 is returned, 
with *tperrno* set to indicate the error.


ERRORS
------
Note that *tpstrerror()* returns generic error message plus custom 
message with debug info from last function call.

*TPEINVAL* flags was not 0 or was not *TPTXCOMMITDLOG*.

*TPETIME* Transaction manager (*tmsrv(8)*) did not respond in configured 
time-out time. The state of transaction is unknown.

*TPEABORT* Global transaction was marked for abort and was aborted, or prepare 
state failed for some of the resource managers and transaction was aborted.

*TPEHAZARD* The state of transaction is not fully know. It can be that it is 
partially committed and partially aborted.

*TPEHEURISTIC* The state of transaction is not full known. The transaction 
heuristically completed.

*TPESVCERR* Failed to call transaction manager, with service error. 
The state of transaction is unknown.

*TPEPROTO* XA subsystem was not initialized (did not call *tpopen()*), 
no global transaction started or caller is not initiator of transaction.

*TPESYSTEM* System failure occurred during serving. See logs i.e. user 
log, or debugs for more info.

*TPEOS* System failure occurred during serving. See logs i.e. user log, 
or debugs for more info.
