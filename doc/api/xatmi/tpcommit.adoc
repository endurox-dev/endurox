NAME
----
tpcommit - Commit global transaction in progress


SYNOPSIS
--------
#include <atmi.h>

int tpcommit (long 'flags');

For XATMI client link with '-latmiclt -latmi -lubf -lnstd -lpthread -lrt -lm'

For XATMI server link with '-latmisrv|-latmisrvnomain|-latmisrvinteg -latmi -lubf -lnstd -lpthread -lrt -lm'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Function does commit the global transaction. Transaction must not be marked as 
abort only (e.g. in case if *tpcall()* failed). After issuing the command, 
*tmsrv(8)* will do the commit procedure, prepare phase first, log the 
results of prepare to persistent storage, and then do the actual commit. The
commit control value value is set either by *tpscmt(3)* or *tx_set_commit_return(3)*
additionally it can be overriden by the *TPTXCOMMITDLOG* flag.

tpcommit() is allowed for autotran started transactions for configured service 
or in service to which autotran stared transaction call was forwarded. 
After executing commit server process normally will leave a transaction.

By default *tpcommit()* performs full commit.

It is forbidden to perform *tpcommit()* having any transactional outstanding calls.
Enduro/X does not explicitly check such calls in progress (direct and/or subsequent 
tpacall, conversational session). If commit is performed in such scenario, 
that might result with orphan active transaction branches, or partial commit 
even having abort-only marking in outstanding call.

In case if process is joined to the transaction (i.e. it is not an initiator
of the transaction) and tpcommit() is called, the error *TPEPROTO* is returned,
process keeps participation in the transaction.

After the call process leaves the global transaction if one is in the progress,
except if noted otherwise in the error description.

*Valid flags*

*TPTXCOMMITDLOG* If set, tpcommit will return when decision for commit is logged
(i.e. first phase of 2 phase commit is done - resource managers are in prepared
state). Thus transaction will be completed by *tmsrv* background thread, which
runs periodically by *-s* (command line argument) seconds.

RETURN VALUE
------------
On success, *tpcommit()* return zero; on error, -1 is returned, 
with *tperrno* set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
------
Note that *tpstrerror()* returns generic error message plus custom 
message with debug info from last function call.

*TPEINVAL* flags was not 0 or was not *TPTXCOMMITDLOG*.
The caller's state with respect to the transaction is not changed.

*TPETIME* Transaction manager (*tmsrv(8)*) did not respond in configured 
time-out time. The state of transaction is unknown.

*TPEABORT* Global transaction was marked for abort and was aborted, or prepare 
state failed for some of the resource managers and transaction was aborted or
abort decision is logged at transaction manager and transaction will be 
aborted in the background.

*TPEHAZARD* Transaction is staged to commit phase, when error occurred. 
Some of the transaction branch resources are not available for transaction 
to be completed and transaction will be completed in background by transaction manager.
Or some of the transaction branch resources have executed commit operation, 
but have reported status that transaction might be partially committed 
or partially aborted.

*TPEHEURISTIC* Transaction is staged to commit phase, when error occurred. 
Some of the transaction branch resources have executed commit operation, 
but have reported status that transaction might be partially committed 
or partially aborted.

*TPESVCERR* Failed to call transaction manager, with service error. 
The state of transaction is unknown.

*TPEPROTO* XA subsystem was not initialized (did not call *tpopen()*), 
no global transaction started or caller is not initiator of transaction.
The caller's state 
with respect to the transaction is not changed.

*TPESYSTEM* System failure occurred during serving. See logs i.e. user 
log, or debugs for more info.

*TPEOS* System failure occurred during serving. See logs i.e. user log, 
or debugs for more info.
