NAME
----
tpcommit - Commit global transaction in progress


SYNOPSIS
--------
#include <atmi.h>

int tpcommit (long 'flags');

For XATMI client link with '-latmiclt -latmi -lubf -lnstd -lpthread -lrt -lm'

For XATMI server link with '-latmisrv|-latmisrvnomain|-latmisrvinteg -latmi -lubf -lnstd -lpthread -lrt -lm'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Function does commit the global transaction. Transaction must not be marked as 
abort only (e.g. in case if *tpcall()* failed). After issuing the command, 
*tmsrv(8)* will do the commit procedure, prepare phase first, log the 
results of prepare to persistent storage, and then do the actual commit. The
commit control value value is set either by *tpscmt(3)* or *tx_set_commit_return(3)*
additionally it can be overriden by the *TPTXCOMMITDLOG* flag.

tpcommit() is allowed for autotran started transactions for configured service 
or in service to which autotran stared transaction call was forwarded. 
After executing commit server process normally will leave a transaction.

By default tpcommit performs full commit.

*Valid flags*

*TPTXCOMMITDLOG* If set, tpcommit will return when decision for commit is logged
(i.e. first phase of 2 phase commit is done - resource managers are in prepared
state). Thus transaction will be completed by *tmsrv* background thread, which
runs periodically by *-s* (command line argument) seconds.

RETURN VALUE
------------
On success, *tpcommit()* return zero; on error, -1 is returned, 
with *tperrno* set to indicate the error.


ERRORS
------
Note that *tpstrerror()* returns generic error message plus custom 
message with debug info from last function call.

*TPEINVAL* flags was not 0 or was not *TPTXCOMMITDLOG*.

*TPETIME* Transaction manager (*tmsrv(8)*) did not respond in configured 
time-out time. The state of transaction is unknown.

*TPEABORT* Global transaction was marked for abort and was aborted, or prepare 
state failed for some of the resource managers and transaction was aborted.

*TPEHAZARD* The state of transaction is not fully know. It can be that it is 
partially committed and partially aborted.

*TPEHEURISTIC* The state of transaction is not full known. The transaction 
heuristically completed.

*TPESVCERR* Failed to call transaction manager, with service error. 
The state of transaction is unknown.

*TPEPROTO* XA subsystem was not initialized (did not call *tpopen()*), 
no global transaction started or caller is not initiator of transaction.

*TPESYSTEM* System failure occurred during serving. See logs i.e. user 
log, or debugs for more info.

*TPEOS* System failure occurred during serving. See logs i.e. user log, 
or debugs for more info.
