SYNOPSIS
--------
#include <atmi.h>

int tpcommit (long 'flags');

For XATMI client link with '-latmiclt -latmi -lubf -lnstd -lpthread -lrt -lm'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Function does commit the global transaction. Transaction must not be marked as abort only (e.g. in case if *tpcall()* failed). After issuing the command, *tmsrv(8)* will do the commit procedure, prepare phase first, log the results of prepare to persistent storage, and then do the actual commit.

RETURN VALUE
------------
On success, *tpcommit()* return zero; on error, -1 is returned, with *tperrno* set to indicate the error.
