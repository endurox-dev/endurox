tpsend - Send message to open conversation


SYNOPSIS
--------
#include <atmi.h>

int tpsend(int 'cd', char *'data', long 'len', long 'flags', long *'revent');


For XATMI client link with '-latmiclt -latmi -lubf -lnstd -lpthread -lrt -lm'

For XATMI server link with '-latmisrv|-latmisrvnomain|-latmisrvinteg -latmi -lubf -lnstd -lpthread -lrt -lm'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Send a message to open conversation, described by 'cd', which is opened by *tpconnect()*. 
The outgoing buffer 'data' must be allocated with *tpalloc()*, if buffer is not 
self describing .e.g *CARRAY*, then 'len' parameter must be correctly set. 
The 'data' can be also set to NULL in that case 'len' is not used.

Enduro/X does not terminate global transaction in case of send failure.

*Valid flags*

*TPRECVONLY* Signal the caller that we want to enter in listening mode. 
The other end will receive *TPEV_SENDONLY* event.

*TPNOBLOCK* Do not block the call if conversational queue is full.

*TPSIGRSTRT* Restart the system call in progress if interrupted by signal handler. 
This affects only underlaying mq_* function calls.

*TPNOBLOCK* Do not block on empty queue, if not messages present, the 
function returns immediately.

RETURN VALUE
------------
On success, *tpcall()* return zero; on error, -1 is returned, with *tperrno* 
set to indicate the error.

*'revent' return values*
*TPEV_DISCONIMM* Conversation have been terminated by *tpdiscon()*

*TPEV_SVCERR* Server died and queue was removed or server did *tpreturn()* 
with *TPSUCCESS*.

*TPEV_SVCFAIL* Server returned *TPFAIL* with *tpreturn()*


ERRORS
------
Note that *tpstrerror()* returns generic error message plus custom message 
with debug info from last function call.

*TPEINVAL* Invalid call descriptor 'cd' passed in or 'data' pointer is 
not pointing to buffer allocated by *tpalloc()*.

*TPETIME* Was unable to send message in given time('NDRX_TOUT' env param.). 

*TPEEVENT* Event received and it is installed into 'revent' field.

*TPESYSTEM* System failure occurred during serving. See logs i.e. user log, 
or debugs for more info.

*TPEOS* System failure occurred during serving. See logs i.e. user log,
 or debugs for more info.
