NAME
----
tprecover - Transaction Processing System Recovery.


SYNOPSIS
--------
'*tprecover*'


DESCRIPTION
-----------
This is special ATMI system process which is started in standard way by
*ndrxd(8)* process application server boot. This service shall be run in single
instance (min=1 and max=1). The process performs monitoring of the
*ndrxd* executable. Two checks at intervals are performed:

1. Check is PID exists.

2. Check the ping response from *ndrxd*

If number of checks overreaches max pings setting, the *ndrxd* is killed by -9
signal (if it was running), and then process is respawned.*tprecover* will start 
a new copy of 'ndrxd', which initially is put in recovery mode.
During recovery mode 'ndrxd' requests all running servers information about their
services. Once learning mode is completed 'ndrxd' will start to do sanity works, pings
and other processes to keep the system in order.

*NOTE:* as pings and performed at intervals and *ndrxd* might be very busy (not
a usual case), the careful calculation of ping timeout should be made, because
*ndrxd* is doing back pings to *tprecover* process. Thus if *tprecover* waits
for ping response for too long time, the ndrxd might kill the *tprecover* by
it self. These settings are controlled in *ndrxconfig.xml(5)*, settings
*<ping_time>* and *<ping_max>*.

OPTIONS
-------

of seconds. The default value is *5*.

value is *20*.

[*-m* 'PING_MAX']::
