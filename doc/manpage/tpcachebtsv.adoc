NAME
----
tpcachebtsv - XATMI Cache boot server (for cache resets at boot)


SYNOPSIS
--------
'*tpcachebtsv*'


DESCRIPTION
-----------
This is special XATMI server which must be present before any XATMI server which
might be subject for cache usage. The server shall be booted in single instance.
The idea is that this server process will load all caches (under given CCTAG if
any) and will process their 'bootreset' flags of the databases. Thus it will clear
up any caches which at startup must be cleaned up. Also note that this clean-up
call is not broadcasted to other Enduro/X cluster nodes.

EXIT STATUS
-----------
*0*::
Success

*-1*::
Failure
