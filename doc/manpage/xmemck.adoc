NAME
----
xmemck - Enduro/X Memory Checker-leak detector


SYNOPSIS
--------
*xmemck* ['OPTIONS']


DESCRIPTION
-----------
*xmemck* tool is used internally by Enduro/X testing suite. The tool is started
before running XATMI level tests. The tool scans the process memory usage over
the time. When scanned processes are finished, tool takes some range of the
Virtual Memory (VSZ) and Resident Memory (RSS) values of the snapshots (made at
certain intervals) and compares average of the first halve with average of the
second halve. If the increase in second halve are bigger then defined percentage,
then memory leak is reported for the binary.

The monitored binaries are selected by regular expressions passed to the command
line. Also for different expressions different percentage settings can be used with
different monitoring parameters. The command line arguments might be repeated
thus at every '-m' the new monitoring set is produced. For monitoring processes
are selected by 'ps -ef' output matched against regexp.

Also it is possible to disable some keywords by regular expressions too. The *xmemck*
can be terminated with SIGTERM.

OPTIONS
-------
[*-p*] 'PERIOID'::
Number of seconds to scan for new processes and read existing processes VSZ and RSS.
Default is *1* second.

[*-d*] 'INCREASE_DELTA_ALLOW'::
This is percentage to allow to increase between to halve average memory usage.
Default is *5* percent.

[*-s*] 'HALVE_START_PERCENT'::
This is number of percents taken from the total pool of process running snapshots,
to be marked as start of the first halve. For example if process have run for
180 seconds, '-p' = 1 then we have 180 snapshots of data.  If '-s' is set to *40*,
then first halve is calculated from 72 sec.
Default is *40*.

[*-t*] 'HALVE_STOP_PERCENT'::
This is ending percentage of the snapshots used for average halving. For example
if runtime was 180 sec, start ('-s') was *40* and stop ('-t') is *90*, then 
we get following setup: average counting from 72 sec till 162 sec. Total 90
snapshots, first halve 72..117 and ending 118..162.

[*-n*] 'NEGATIVE_REGEX_MASK'::
If set, then when *xmemck* is selecting the processes for monitoring the given
'ps -ef' line must not match the '-n' parameter. If matches, then process is not
monitored.

[*-v*] 'MIN_VALUES'::
Minimum number of values to use in one halve. If the number of snapshots is less
than this number for the halve, then memory leak detection is not performed on
this process.

*-m* 'REGEX_MASK'::
Regex mask used for process selection from 'ps -ef' output. If line matches the
given expression, then PID is extracted and binary is monitored at '-p' interval
for VSZ and RSS.


EXAMPLE RUN
-----------
Sample run of the binary:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

$ xmemck -v20 -d30 -s60 -t95 -n 'atmiunit1|tpbridge|tmsrv' -m atmi -d70 -m tpbridge -m tmsrv 2>./memck.log 1>./memck.out &

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The given example monitors following:

- (-v20) Min values 20

- (-d30) Allow delta 30%

- (-s60) Start at 60% of the runtime snapshots

- (-t95) Stop calculating averages of the 95% of snapshots

- (-n 'atmiunit1|tpbridge|tmsrv') Do not match 'atmiunit1', 'tpbridge' or 'tmsrv'

- (-m atmi) Match "atmi"

- (-d90) Change delta to 70 for next match

- (-m tpbridge) Monitor process named *tpbridge*

- (-m tmsrv) Monitor process named *tmsrv*

When leak is detected, the following infos is printed to stdout:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

>>> LEAK pid=8605! rss: 21766 -> 32712 (+33.461727%), vsz 25412 -> 36337 (+30.065773%): [mvitolin  8605  7319  0 22:05 pts/17   00:00:00 ./a.out]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


EXIT STATUS
-----------
*0*::
Success

*1*::
Failure
