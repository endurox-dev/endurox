NAME
----
ndrxd - EnduroX local ATMI monitor.


SYNOPSIS
--------
*ndrxd* ['OPTIONS']


DESCRIPTION
-----------
This is endurox backend daemon. Normally it is startd by EnduroX
command line utlity xadmin. But for recovery mode it can be started
by hand. 'ndrxd' is responsible for starting/stopping ATMI servers.
It also monitors the servers, restarts them if they are crashed. It
can perform server pinging, in case if ping fails it might restart them.
The front-end for 'ndrxd' is 'xadmin'. 'xadmin' is responsible for
starting idle instance of the daemon. When idle instance is started,
it waits for commands from 'xadmin'.

During the server startup, daemon recieves lists of advertised services
from servers. Service queues are opened by servers. But when services
are shutdown, 'ndrxd' counts the instances of the servers advertising
services. If count gets 0, 'ndrxd' removes service queues.

In case of clustered mode, 'ndrxd' via 'tpbridge' sends updates to
other EnduroX instances. 


OPTIONS
-------
*-k* 'RANDOM_KEY'::
Random key associate with EnduroX instance. This is used so that
shell scripts can identify processes belonging the some specific
instance of EnduroX.

*-r*::
Restart/Recovery mode. This is used when 'ndrxd' process is killed
during applicaton domain running. When starting in this mode, 'ndrxd'
will request service listings from running servers (resolved from
queues, usually <prefix>,srv,admin,<server>. In given time frame
(set via configuration) servers must provide listings. After the
learing timeframe, 'ndrxd' starts to act as it would work normally,
i.e. kill unresponsible services, etc.
