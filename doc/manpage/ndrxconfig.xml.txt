DESCRIPTION
-----------
'ndrxconfig.xml' holds the application domain configuration. It describes the ATMI
servers which needs to be started. Counts of the, how much to start. Also it
describes sanity times i.e. period after which system sanity checks should be made.
Also it describes time frames in which ATMI server should start or stop.
Internal server ping can be configured here too.


DEBUG CONFIGURATION FILE SYNTAX
-------------------------------

*SANITY_SECONDS*::
	Number of seconds after which perform system sanity checks. This number
	should divide by environment variable value 'NDRX_CMDWAIT'. As this actually
	is time by which 'ndrxd' sleeps periodically.
*BRIDGE_REFRESH_TIME*::
	Number of sanity units in which 'tpbridge' refresh should be send to other node.
	If for example SANITY_SECONDS is set to 10, and BRIDGE_REFRESH_TIME is set to 2
	then period between bridge refreshes will be 10*2 = 20 seconds.
*MIN_RESTART_TIME*::
	Number of sanity units in which died server will be tried to start back. This is
	minimal time, means that this time is applied in case if server was running and died.
	If it is consecutive try, then RESTART_STEP is applied on this timer.	
*RESTART_STEP*::
	Number to sanity units to apply on 'MIN_RESTART_TIME' in case of consecutive server death.
	Meaning that next try of restart will tried later that previous by this
	number of sanity units.
*MAX_RESTART_TIME*::
	Max number of sanity units after which server will tried to restart.
	After each consecutive ATMI server death, next reboot is tried
	by 'MIN_RESTART_TIME'+'RESTART_STEP'*try_count. If this goes over the
	'MAX_RESTART_TIME' then 'MAX_RESTART_TIME' is used instead.
*NDRXD_RESTART_TO_CHECK*::
	Number of *seconds* for 'ndrxd' to wait after daemon started in recovery
	mode. Within this time no sanity checks are perfomed, but instead "learning" mode
	is used. During this mode, 'ndrxd' asks each ATMI server for it's configuration.
	If in this time ATMI server does not responds, then ATMI server is subject
	of sanity checks.
*NDRXD_GATHER_PQ_STATS*::
        Settings for *pq* 'xadmin' command. if set to 'Y', ndrxd will automatically collect
        stats for service queues. In future this might be used for automatic service starting
        and stopping.
*MIN_SERVERS_DEFAULT*::
	Default minimum number of copies of the server which needs to be started automatically.
	This can be overriden by 'MIN_SERVERS_SRV' per server.
*MAX_SERVERS_DEFAULT*::
	Max number of ATMI server copies per ATMI server entry. The difference between
	MIN and MAX servers means the number of standby servers configured. They can be started
	by hand with out system re-configuration. But they are not booted automatically at
	system startup. You will have to start them with $ xadmin start -s <server_name>
	or by $ xadmin start -i <server_id>. This can be overriden by
	'MAX_SERVERS_SRV'.
*AUTOKILL_DEFAULT*::
	Should server be automatically killed (by sequence signal sequence 
	-2, -15, -9) in case if server have been starting up too long, or
	does not respond to pings too long, or it is performing shutdown
	too long. This can be overriden by 'AUTOKILL_SRV' on per server
	basis.
*ENV_OVERRIDE_DEFAULT*::
	Full path to file containing environment variable overrides.
	see 'ex_envover(5)' for more details. This can be overriden
	by per server basis by ENV_OVERRIDE_SRV. 
	Both are optional settings.
*MAX_STARTUP_TIME_DEFAULT*::
	Max time (in sanity units) in which server should start up, i.e. send init info to
	'ndrxd'. If during this time server have not initialized, it is being restarted. This
	can be overriden by 'MAX_STARTUP_TIME_SRV'.
*PING_EVERY_TIME_DEFAULT*::
	Number of sanity units in which perform peridical server pings. This can be
	overriden by 'PING_EVERY_TIME_SRV'. Zero value disables ping.
*MAX_PING_TIME_DEFAULT*::
	Number of sanity units, time in which server *must* respond to ping requests.
	If there is no response from server within this time, then restart sequence is
	initiated. This can be overriden by 'MAX_PING_TIME_SRV'.
*MAX_SERVER_SHUTDOWN_TIME_DEFAULT*::
	Maximum time in which shutdown of server must complete in sanity units.
	If in given time server is not shutdown, then forced shutdown sequence
	is started until server exits. This can be overriden by 'MAX_SERVER_SHUTDOWN_TIME_SRV'
	on per server basis.
*EXPORT_SERVICES_DEFAULT*::
    Comma seperated list of services to be applied to all binaries which means the list of
    services to be exported by tpbridge service to the node. This can be overriden by 
    'ATMI_SERVER_EXPORT_SERVICES'.
*KILL_TIME_DEFAULT*::
	Time in sanity units after which to progress from first signal -2 to next signal
	-15. And after -15 this time means when next -9 signal will be sent. This is used
	if forced restart of forced shutdown was initiated by 'ndrxd'. This
	can be overriden by 'KILL_TIME_SRV'.
*SECONDS_TO_SLEEP_AFTER_SRV_START*::
	Number of seconds to wait for next item to start after the server is launched.
	This is useful in cases when for example we start bridge server, let it for some
	seconds to connect to other node, then continue with other service startup.
*SERVER_BINARY_NAME*::
	ATMI server executable's name. The executable must be in $PATH.
	This name cannot contain special symbols like path seperator '/'
	and it cannot contains commas ','! Commas are used as internal
	queue seperator combined with binary names.
*SERVER_ID*::
	Server ID. It is internal ID for server instance. For each seperate ATMI server
	the ID must be unique. Also special care should be take when MAX_SERVERS_SRV is greater
	than 1. In this case up till MAX servers, internally 'SERVER_ID' is incremented.
	Thus for example if SERVER_ID is 200, and MAX_SERVERS_SRV is 5, then
	following server IDs will be reserved: 200, 201, 202, 203, 204. The maximum server
	id is set in $NDRX_SRVMAX environment variable. Minimal server id is 1.
*ATMI_SERVER_SYSTEM_OPTIONS*::
	Command line system options passed to ATMI server. Following paramters are
	used by EnduroX ATMI servers: '-N', boolean type. If present, then no services
	will be advertised by server. In this case will be advertised only services specified
	by '-s' flag. For example if server advertises SERVICE1, SERVICE2, SERVICE3, but '-N'
	was specified, and '-sSERVICE3' is specified, then only service SERVICE3 will be 
	advertised. The '-s' argument also can contain aliases for services, for example
	'-sOTHERSVC:SERVICE2', then new service OTHERSVC will be advertised which
	basically is the same SERVICE2 (same function used). '-s' and '-N' can be mixed.
	'-s' can appear multiple times in system options.
	Server binaries output is controlled via '-e LOG_FILE', which means
	that stdout & stderr of server is dumped to LOG_FILE.
	There are few internal params: param '-k' is just a random key
	for shell scripts. Another internal param is Server ID which is automatically passed
	to binary via '-i SERVER_ID'.
*ATMI_SERVER_APPLICATION_OPTIONS*::
	Application specific command line options. This follows content after sys options as:
	'system options -- app options'.
*ATMI_SERVER_EXPORT_SERVICES*::
    EnduroX server specific list of services to be exported. This list is only for 
    *tpbridge* servers.
