NAME
----
cpmsrv - Client Process Monitor Server.


SYNOPSIS
--------
*cpmrv* ['OPTIONS']


DESCRIPTION
-----------
Client process monitor is Enduro/X server process which is responsible for managing client processes,
which are described in 'ndrxconfig.xml', '<clients>' section. The process reloads configuration file
every time when timestamp is changed. If process is removed from '<clients>' section and process
is stopped, then it is removed from listings. If process is running, it is left in current process model.

'cpmsrv' is servicing backend functionality for xadmin's pc (print clients), bc (boot client), 
sc (stop client) commands. Invoked via ATMI subsystem resources.

During the startup phase, all 'autostart' processes are started. During the shutdown phase all started
processes are shut-down, by doing standard kill signalling.

If using wildcards in bc/sc/rc commands, then please ensure that estimated start/stop
times are shorter than *cpmsrv* max ping time (if enabled in ndrxconfig.xml). Otherwise
the cpmsrv might be killed by *ndrxd* because it will assume that *cpmsrv* is not
responding.
