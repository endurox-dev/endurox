DESCRIPTION
-----------
'ndrxconfig.xml' holds the application domain configuration. It describes the ATMI
servers which needs to be started. Counts of the, how much to start. Also it
describes sanity times i.e. period after which system sanity checks should be made.
Also it describes time frames in which ATMI server should start or stop.
Internal server ping can be configured here too.


DEBUG CONFIGURATION FILE SYNTAX
-------------------------------

*SANITY_SECONDS*::
    Number of seconds after which perform system sanity checks. This number
    should divide by environment variable value 'NDRX_CMDWAIT'. As this actually
    is time by which 'ndrxd' sleeps periodically.
*CHECKPM_STY*::
    This is number of sanity cycles into which check dead processes from the
    process model. This makes the actual checking of th PID existence system.
    Thus if ndrxd is started in learning mode and will not receive signals
    of the dead servers, then by setting it will discover exited processes.
*BRIDGE_REFRESH_TIME*::
    Number of sanity units in which 'tpbridge' refresh should be send to other node.
    If for example SANITY_SECONDS is set to 10, and BRIDGE_REFRESH_TIME is set to 2
    then period between bridge refreshes will be 10*2 = 20 seconds.
    Default value is *0* - do not send full updates.
*MIN_RESTART_TIME*::
    Number of sanity units in which died server will be tried to start back. This is
    minimal time, means that this time is applied in case if server was running and died.
    If it is consecutive try, then RESTART_STEP is applied on this timer.	
*RESTART_STEP*::
    Number to sanity units to apply on 'MIN_RESTART_TIME' in case of consecutive server death.
    Meaning that next try of restart will tried later that previous by this
    number of sanity units.
*MAX_RESTART_TIME*::
    Max number of sanity units after which server will tried to restart.
    After each consecutive ATMI server death, next reboot is tried
    by 'MIN_RESTART_TIME'+'RESTART_STEP'*try_count. If this goes over the
    'MAX_RESTART_TIME' then 'MAX_RESTART_TIME' is used instead.
*NDRXD_RESTART_TO_CHECK*::
    Number of *seconds* for 'ndrxd' to wait after daemon started in recovery
    mode. Within this time no sanity checks are perfomed, but instead "learning" mode
    is used. During this mode, 'ndrxd' asks each ATMI server for it's configuration.
    If in this time ATMI server does not responds, then ATMI server is subject
    of sanity checks.
*NDRXD_GATHER_PQ_STATS*::
    Settings for *pq* 'xadmin' command. if set to 'Y', ndrxd will automatically collect
    stats for service queues. In future this might be used for automatic service starting
    and stopping.
*RQADDRTTL*::
    Used only when operating System V queues mode. Due to common queue for
    multiple services / basically all service queues are shared request addresses,
    the only zapping approach when there are no servers on queues, is to check
    that in service shared memory there are no linked request address queues,
    and at time perform unlink of the request address queue. But here we have a
    problem. The XATMI server might just started up, opened the RQADDR queue,
    but did not yet managed to install record in service shared memory. Thus
    'ndrxd' will unlink the RQADDR. To avoid this issue, with TTL slight delay
    is introduced, after which queue is unlinked. Basically when queue is open
    it's change time is updated. And if current time minus change time is
    less than *RQADDRTTL*, then queue is not unlinked (in this time server will
    be able to add record to service shared memory). Also with this comes a fact
    that there must be no server processes with out any service. For those
    request address queue will be unlinked.
    The value is in seconds. Checks are performed with *SANITY_SECONDS* intervals.
    Default value is *10* seconds.
*MIN_SERVERS_DEFAULT*::
    Default minimum number of copies of the server which needs to be started automatically.
    This can be overridden by 'MIN_SERVERS_SRV' per server.
*MAX_SERVERS_DEFAULT*::
    Max number of ATMI server copies per ATMI server entry. The difference between
    MIN and MAX servers means the number of standby servers configured. They can be started
    by hand with out system re-configuration. But they are not booted automatically at
    system startup. You will have to start them with $ xadmin start -s <server_name>
    or by $ xadmin start -i <server_id>. This can be overridden by
    'MAX_SERVERS_SRV'.
*AUTOKILL_DEFAULT*::
    Should server be automatically killed (by sequence signal sequence 
    -2, -15, -9) in case if server have been starting up too long, or
    does not respond to pings too long, or it is performing shutdown
    too long. This can be overridden by 'AUTOKILL_SRV' on per server
    basis.
*ENV_OVERRIDE_DEFAULT*::
    Full path to file containing environment variable overrides.
    see 'ex_envover(5)' for more details. This can be overridden
    by per server basis by ENV_OVERRIDE_SRV. 
    Both are optional settings.
*MAX_STARTUP_TIME_DEFAULT*::
    Max time (in sanity units) in which server should start up, i.e. send init info to
    'ndrxd'. If during this time server have not initialized, it is being restarted. This
    can be overridden by 'MAX_STARTUP_TIME_SRV'.
*PING_EVERY_TIME_DEFAULT*::
    Number of sanity units in which perform periodical server pings. This can be
    overridden by 'PING_EVERY_TIME_SRV'. Zero value disables ping.
*MAX_PING_TIME_DEFAULT*::
    Number of sanity units, time in which server *must* respond to ping requests.
    If there is no response from server within this time, then restart sequence is
    initiated. This can be overridden by 'MAX_PING_TIME_SRV'.
*MAX_SERVER_SHUTDOWN_TIME_DEFAULT*::
    Maximum time in which shutdown of server must complete in sanity units.
    If in given time server is not shutdown, then forced shutdown sequence
    is started until server exits. This can be overridden by 'MAX_SERVER_SHUTDOWN_TIME_SRV'
    on per server basis.
*EXPORT_SERVICES_DEFAULT*::
    Comma separated list of services to be applied to all binaries which means the list of
    services to be exported by *tpbridge* server to other cluster node. This can be overridden by 
    'ATMI_SERVER_EXPORT_SERVICES'.
*BLACKLIST_SERVICES_DEFAULT*::
    Comma separated list of services to be applied to all server binaries which means the list of
    services that must not be exported by *tpbridge* server to other cluster node.
    'ATMI_SERVER_BLACKLIST_SERVICES' is first priority over the 'EXPORT_SERVICES_DEFAULT' if
    service appears in both lists. 'BLACKLIST_SERVICES_DEFAULT' can be overridden by 
    'ATMI_SERVER_BLACKLIST_SERVICES'. 
*NDRXD_SRV_START_WAIT_DEFAULT*::
    Number of seconds to wait for servers to boot. If not started in given time,
    then continue with next server. This can be overridden by 'NDRXD_SRV_START_WAIT'.
    Default value for this is 30 seconds.
*NDRXD_SRV_STOP_WAIT_DEFAULT*::
    Number of seconds to wait for server to shutdown. If not started in given time,
    then continue with next server. This can be overridden by 'NDRXD_SRV_STOP_WAIT_DEFAULT'.
    Default value for this is 30 seconds.
*KILL_TIME_DEFAULT*::
    Time in sanity units after which to progress from first signal -2 to next signal
    -15. And after -15 this time means when next -9 signal will be sent. This is used
    if forced restart of forced shutdown was initiated by 'ndrxd'. This
    can be overridden by 'KILL_TIME_SRV'.
*COMMON_CONFIG_TAG_DEFAULT*::
    Common configuration tag. Loaded into 'NDRX_CCTAG' environment variable before
    process is spawned. This can be overridden by 'COMMON_CONFIG_TAG'.
*PROTECTED_SERVER_DEFAULT*::
    Protected server is one that does not shutdown with 'xadmin stop' unless you pass the
    'xadmin stop -c' parameter (complete shutdown). Still you can run the 'sreload' and 
    stop it by 'xadmin stop -i <srvid>' or by 'xadmin stop -s <servernm>'. The 'xadmin restart'
    won't work on these because '-c' is not supposed to be used by restart.
    The idea behind this, is to avoid accidental stop of the critical servers, like bridge or
    something else which is involved into 'ndrxd' daemon management it self.
    This can be overridden by 'PROTECTED_SERVER'.
*RELOAD_ON_CHANGE_DEFAULT*::
    If set to *Y* or *y* the *ndrxd* daemon will scan the every binaries time stamp,
    and if it detects that time stamp is changed *ndrxd* will reload (stop/start)
    the XATMI servers one by one. The scanning will occur at every sanity
    cycle. This is recommended to be used *only* for development purposes. And
    must not be used on production servers! 
    This can be overridden by 'RELOAD_ON_CHANGE_SERVER' on per server basis.
*RSSMAX_DEFAULT*::
    Maximum Resident Set Size memory size after which *ndrxd(8)* process will issue
    server reload (sr) command (i.e. gracefully 
    shutdown and start back) to server process if
    particular server process resident memory goes over this defined value. 
    The value can be override by *ATMI_SERVER_RSSMAX* for particular server 
    instance.
    This parameter is useful to be used to protect local machine against 
    defective/binaries with memory leaks. The parameter value is 
    expressed in bytes. Configuration file also accepts
    suffixes such as "T" or "t" for terrabytes, "G" or "g" for gigabytes, "M" or
    "m" for megabytes and "K" or "k" for kilobytes. For example "10M" would
    limit resident memory to 10 megabytes. The default value is *-1*, which 
    means that functionality is not used.
*VSZMAX_DEFAULT*::
    Maximum Virtual Set Size memory size (the number bytes program have asked to 
    OS kernel for memory, but does it does *not* mean it is physically used or initialized) 
    after which *ndrxd(8)* process will issue
    server reload (sr) command (i.e. gracefully shutdown and start back) to
    server process if particular server's process virtual memory goes 
    over this defined value. The value can be override by 
    *ATMI_SERVER_VSZMAX* for particular server instance.
    This parameter is useful to be used to protect local machine
    defective/binaries with memory leaks. The parameter value is 
    expressed in bytes. Configuration file also accepts
    suffixes such as "T" or "t" for terrabytes, "G" or "g" for gigabytes, "M" or
    "m" for megabytes and "K" or "k" for kilobytes. For example "10M" would
    limit resident memory to 10 megabytes. The default value is *-1*, which 
    means that functionality is not used.
*RQADDR_DEFAULT*::
    Request address (common service queue) used in System V mode. For other
    modes each service have it's own queue, but due to limitations of the System V
    queues, for each XATMI server process have it's own queue (built as process
    /exe name and service id) or processes can share the queue by having this
    request address, thus getting a one queue multiple servers mechanism for
    message dispatching. Also all servers attached on the same request address
    must advertise all the services from all servers attached on the same
    request address. If some server will miss a service, it might receive request
    for particular service, the error will be logged and message will be dropped,
    thus caller will get a timeout. If different request addresses are serving
    the same service, then request will be load balanced in round-robin mode.
    This can be overridden by 'RQADDR' on per server basis. Request address
    cannot start with '@' symbol. The max length of the request address is *30*
    chars.
*SECONDS_TO_SLEEP_AFTER_SRV_START*::
    Number of seconds to wait for next item to start after the server is launched.
    This is useful in cases when for example we start bridge server, let it for some
    seconds to connect to other node, then continue with other service startup.
*SERVER_BINARY_NAME*::
    ATMI server executable's name. The executable must be in $PATH.
    This name cannot contain special symbols like path separator '/'
    and it cannot contains commas ','! Commas are used as internal
    queue separator combined with binary names.
*RESPAWN_SRV*::
    Do the automatic process re-spawning if process is died for some reason. The default
    value is *Y*, meaning that processes are automatically recovered. If set to 'N' or 'n',
    then sanity checks will not automatically re-boot the process.
*SERVER_ID*::
    Server ID. It is internal ID for server instance. For each separate ATMI server
    the ID must be unique. Also special care should be take when MAX_SERVERS_SRV is greater
    than 1. In this case up till MAX servers, internally 'SERVER_ID' is incremented.
    Thus for example if SERVER_ID is 200, and MAX_SERVERS_SRV is 5, then
    following server IDs will be reserved: 200, 201, 202, 203, 204. The maximum server
    id is set in $NDRX_SRVMAX environment variable. Minimal server id is 1.
*ATMI_SERVER_SYSTEM_OPTIONS*::
    Command line system options passed to ATMI server. Following parameters are
    used by Enduro/X ATMI servers: '-N', boolean type. If present, then no services
    will be advertised by server. In this case will be advertised only services specified
    by '-s' flag. For example if server advertises SERVICE1, SERVICE2, SERVICE3, but '-N'
    was specified, and '-sSERVICE3' is specified, then only service SERVICE3 will be 
    advertised. The '-s' argument also can contain aliases for services, for example
    '-sOTHERSVC:SERVICE2', then new service OTHERSVC will be advertised which
    basically is the same SERVICE2 (same function used). '-s' and '-N' can be mixed.
    '-s' can appear multiple times in system options. With one '-s' multiple services
    can be aliased to single existing service.
    The format is: '-s<NEWSVC1>/<NEWSVC2>/../<NEWSVCN>:<EXISTINGSVC>'. The ',' can be
    used as separator too, but for certain platforms it does not work, thus '/' is
    recommended. When using full advertise (all service) some of them can be masked
    by '-n' flag. For example '-sSERVICE4' will advertise all, but 'SERVICE4'. Flag
    '-n' can be repeated multiple times.
    Server binaries output is controlled via '-e LOG_FILE', which means
    that stdout & stderr of server is dumped to LOG_FILE.
    There are few internal params: param '-k' is just a random key
    for shell scripts. Another internal param is Server ID which is automatically passed
    to binary via '-i SERVER_ID'.
    Enduro/X supports automatic buffer conversion for ATMI servers. 
    Currently supported modes are 'JSON2UBF', 'UBF2JSON', these modes are activated 
    by -x paramter in system options. These modes are passed for server functions 
    being advertised. For example if we have service *functions* (not services) 
    UBF1FUNC, UBF2FUNC and JSONFUNC and we want to ensure that these receive
    converted messages even if caller to UBF service sends JSON and vice versa, then 
    following options might be set to command line:
    '-xUBF1FUNC,UBF2FUNC:JSON2UBF -xJSONFUNC:UBF2JSON'.
    When Enduro/X is build with integration lib (libatmisrvinteg) user have ability
    to map the functions with -S <service_name1>/<service_name2>:<function name>
    passed to buildserver at build time or registered in tmdsptchtbl_t array
    passed to _tmstartserver(). The -S are processed and service array is prepared,
    afterwards the -N and -s<service_name1> flag works as usual, with -N disable
    all service advertise and with -s some single service may be enabled.

*ATMI_SERVER_APPLICATION_OPTIONS*::
    Application specific command line options. This follows content after sys options as:
    'system options -- app options'.
*ATMI_SERVER_EXPORT_SERVICES*::
    Enduro/X server specific list of services to be exported. This list is only for 
    *tpbridge* servers.
*ATMI_SERVER_BLACKLIST_SERVICES*::
    Enduro/X server specific list of services that must not be exported. This list is only for 
    *tpbridge* servers. Blacklist have higher priority over the Export list.
*ATMI_SERVER_FULL_PATH*::
    This is full path of the XATMI server binary. At the process startup this overrides
    the server binary name at *SERVER_BINARY_NAME*. *ATMI_SERVER_FULL_PATH* is used only
    for process startup. This is intended for testing, if server wrapper scripts
    needs to be started. But as the *ndrxd* will do the sanity checks against the process
    names, for time of the testing this needs to be disabled. Thus to do the testings with
    full path enabled, please increase the 'checkpm' sanity unit time. As at the moment
    of process model checks, the ndrxd will find out that wrapped binary name does not
    contain the *SERVER_BINARY_NAME*, thus will reboot the process.
*ATMI_SERVER_COMMAND_LINE*::
    This is alternative command line build by user. From this command line the
    real process name is extracted as first executable (basename). When  building
    custom command line, the env substitution is available at the stage with
    following processes based envs (not counting the globals): *NDRX_SVSRVID* -
    Enduro/X server id, *NDRX_SVPROCNAME* - server process name (defined in XML
    config as *SERVER_BINARY_NAME* variable, *NDRX_SVCLOPT* - standard command
    line options used by Enduro/X. These options are used at stage with ATMI
    server library gets initialized, it will use in case *ndrx_main()* receives
    less than expected standard argument count. Basically this command line tag
    is suitable for interpreted languages, like Java, where interpreter needs to
    be started as stand alone binary, and the Enduro/X is initialized as a library
    within stand alone process.
*SVGRP_ENV_GROUP_NAME*::
    Environment variable group name for the servers section. Identifier max length
    is 30 chars. Same group can be used for different server processes. One server
    may import multiple groups. For client processes groups are defined 
    *CLTGRP_ENV_GROUP_NAME* name at '<clients>' section. At process level groups
    can be imported by using tag '<usegroup>' and specifying the group name. At
    that moment all variables defined in group are import for process. 
*SVGRP_ENV_VARIABLE_NAME*::
    This server server's group environment variable name, that shall be set for
    process which uses this group. For client processes *CLTGRP_ENV_VARIABLE_NAME*
    set the variable name at group definition. Individual environment variables
    can be set at process level. For server processes that is set by
    *SVPROC_ENV_VARIABLE_NAME* and for client processes by *CLTPROC_ENV_VARIABLE_NAME*.
*SVGRP_ENV_VARIABLE_VALUE*::
    This is environment variable value to be set. For client process groups this
    is defined by *CLTGRP_ENV_VARIABLE_VALUE*. For individual processes value is
    defined by *SVPROC_ENV_VARIABLE_NAME* and *CLTPROC_ENV_VARIABLE_NAME*
    accordingly. The value is interpreted by variable substitution algorithm (see 
    bellow). The value is interpreted at time when process is spawned (not defined),
    meaning that it have access to full process variables at startup moment.
*SVGRP_ENV_UNSET*::
    If set to 'y' or 'Y' then environment's environment variable is unset (removed)
    from environment. This can be used if some specific variable for process is
    not needed. At client environment group level this can be set by *CLTGRP_ENV_UNSET*,
    at process levels this can be set by *SVPROC_ENV_UNSET* and *CLTPROC_ENV_UNSET*
    accordingly. If any value is present for this variable, it is ignored, as the
    main action of this tag is unset the value and only what matters here is the
    variable name.
*CLT_COMMAND_LINE*::
    Executable name and arguments for client program. Command line basically is a format
    string for which you can use '${NDRX_CLTTAG}' for tag substitution and '${NDRX_CLTSUBSECT}'
    for subsection substitution. Other env variables available here too.
*CLT_LOG*::
    Logfile to which stdout and stderr is logged. Can be overridden by 'CLT_LOG_EXEC'
    for each individual process. Optional attribute.
*CLT_STDOUT*::
    File where to log stdout. Can be overridden by 'CLT_STDOUT_EXEC'
    for each individual process. Optional attribute.
*CLT_STDERR*::
    File where to log stderr. Can be overridden by 'CLT_STDERR_EXEC'
    for each individual process. Optional attribute.
*CLTGRP_ENV*::
    Environment override file. See *ex_envover(5)* for syntax. Can be overridden 
    by 'CLTGRP_ENV_EXEC' for each individual process. Optional attribute.
*CLT_CCTAG*::
    ATMI Client lib Common-Config tag. Can be overridden by 'CLT_CCTAG_EXEC'
    for each individual process. Optional attribute.
*CLT_WD*::
    Working directory for the process. Can be overridden by 'CLT_WD_EXEC'.
*CLT_AUTOSTART*::
    Should process be started automatically? 'Y' or 'y' means boot at start.
    Can be overridden by 'CLT_AUTOSTART_EXEC' for each individual process. 
    Optional attribute. Default 'n'.
*CLT_TAG_EXEC*::
    Tagname to be set for process.
*CLT_SUBSECT_EXEC*::
    Subsection to be set for process. '-' used as default.
*CLT_RSSMAX*::
    Maximum Resident Set Size memory size after which *cpmsrv(8)* process will 
    gracefully kill the client process by signals -2, -15, -9 if
    particular client process resident memory goes over this defined value. 
    After killing, the cpmsrv at first check interval will detect that client
    is dead, and at next check interval it will be respawned.
    The value can be override by *CLT_RSSMAX_EXEC*.
    This parameter is useful to be used to protect local machine against 
    defective/binaries with memory leaks. The parameter value is 
    expressed in bytes. Configuration file also accepts
    suffixes such as "T" or "t" for terrabytes, "G" or "g" for gigabytes, "M" or
    "m" for megabytes and "K" or "k" for kilobytes. For example "10M" would
    limit resident memory to 10 megabytes. The default value is *-1*, which 
    means that functionality is not used.
*CLT_VSZMAX*::
    Maximum Virtual Set Size memory size (the number bytes program have asked to 
    OS kernel for memory, but does it does *not* mean it is physically used or initialized) 
    after which *cpmsrv(8)* process will 
    gracefully kill the client process by signals -2, -15, -9 if
    particular client process virtual memory goes over this defined value.
    After killing, the cpmsrv at first check interval will detect that client
    is dead, and at next check interval it will be respawned.
    The value can be override by *CLT_RSSMAX_EXEC*.
    This parameter is useful to be used to protect local machine against 
    defective/binaries with memory leaks. The parameter value is 
    expressed in bytes. Configuration file also accepts
    suffixes such as "T" or "t" for terrabytes, "G" or "g" for gigabytes, "M" or
    "m" for megabytes and "K" or "k" for kilobytes. For example "10M" would
    limit resident memory to 10 megabytes. The default value is *-1*, which 
    means that functionality is not used.
*CLT_SUBSECTFROM*::
    If set, then used to auto-generate number subsections for particular client
    definition. In this case *CLT_SUBSECT_EXEC* parameter value is ignored.
    The loop must start with non negative number and must not be greater than
    integer (2147483647) and less or equal to *CLT_SUBSECTTO*. 
    Default is *undefined* and not used. Can be overriden
    by *CLT_SUBSECTFROM_EXEC*. Must be used together with *CLT_SUBSECTTO*.
*CLT_SUBSECTTO*::
    If set, then used to auto-generate number subsections for particular client
    definition. In this case *CLT_SUBSECT_EXEC* parameter value is ignored.
    The loop must end with non negative number and must not be greater than
    integer (2147483647). Default is *undefined* and not used. Can be overriden
    by *CLT_SUBSECTFROM_EXEC*. Must be used together with *CLT_SUBSECTFROM*.
*CLT_KLEVEL*::
    Kill level of the client. *0* - do not kill child processes recursively 
    of the client, *1* - do kill child processes only when performing 
    SIGKILL (-9), *2* - do kill on SIGTERM and SIGINT child processes.
    The default is *0*.

VARIABLE SUBSTITUTION
---------------------

Several parameters in the ndrxconfig.xml file are processed via substitution 
engine. Engine processes puts the environment variables or special functions
in the place-holders. Placeholder is defined as ${ENV_VARIABLE} for environment
variables and ${FUNC=[PARAMETER]} for functions. The value can be escaped with 
\${some_value}.

Functions are processed in case if statement in brackets contains equal sign '='.
As the sign is not allowed for environment variables, Enduro/X uses it to 
distinguish between env variable and function.

Following *FUNC* (functions) are defined:

*dec*::
    Decrypt base64 string in *PARAMETER* and replace the placeholder with the
    value. To get encrypted value, it is possible to use *exencrypt(8)* tool.
