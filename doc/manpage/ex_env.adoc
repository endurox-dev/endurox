ex_env - Enduro/X Environment configuration

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Enduro/X use set of environment variables which is initial environment
for application domain. There is set of parameters related to system,
prefixes, Posix Queue mount points, various system limits. Next step
to the configuration is application domain configuration by it self, 
in 'ndrxconfig.xml' and 'debug.conf' (or Common-Configuration respectively).

Mandatory Env. Variables
------------------------
*NDRX_NODEID*='NODE_ID'::
    Cluster Node ID. Should be within 1..32.
*NDRX_CLUSTERISED*='1|0'::
    Do we work in cluster mode or not? '1' - yes, we are in cluster. 
    '0' - no, we are not in cluster.
*NDRX_LDBAL*='LOAD_BALANCE_PERCENT'::
    if LOAD_BALANCE_PERCENT is 0 = means process all locally, 
    if value is set to 100 = process all on remote servers (if svc
    available on remote server). 70% means, process 30% locally
    70% remotely.
*NDRX_TOUT*='TIME_OUT_IN_SECONDS'::
    Global tpcall() timeout, if not called with TPNOTIME flag.
    If process will not return in this time, then TPETIME error
    will be returned.
*NDRX_ULOG*='ULOG_PATH'::
    Writable system path where to write user logs.
*NDRX_QPREFIX*='APP_PREFIX'::
    Prefix used for POSIX IPC resources (shm and queue).
*NDRX_SVCMAX*='MAX_SERVICES'::
    This determines the maximum number of services supported by instance.
    The less is number, then less shared memory is used. However for
    performance reason, number should be much bigger (3-4 times) than
    actual estimated service count. Bigger number might speed up linear
    hashing, i.e. it will be less likely that hash will collide.
*NDRX_SRVMAX*='MAX_SERVERS'::
    Maximum number of servers that will be supported. This affects the
    '-i' flag. Server ID. The max server id will be MAX_SERVERS-1.
*NDRX_CONFIG*='FULL_PATH_TO_CONFIG_FILE'::
    This shows the full path to usual ndrxconfig.xml.
*NDRX_QPATH*='QUEUE_MOUNT_POINT'::
    Full path to directory where POSIX Queue is mounted.
*NDRX_SHMPATH*='SHARED_MEM_MOUNT_POINT'::
    Full path to POSIX Shared memory mount point.
*NDRX_CMDWAIT*='NDRXD_COMMAND_WAIT_SECS'::
    Number of second to wait for commands, after which 'ndrxd' does other checks.
*NDRX_DPID*='PATH_TO_NDRXD_PID_FILE'::
    This is full path to 'ndrxd' PID file.
*NDRX_RNDK*='APP_DOMAIN_RANDOM_KEY'::
    Random key to indentify the processes beloning to
    this app domain (i.e. used in ps ef).
*NDRX_IPCKEY*='SYS_V_SEMAPHORE_KEY'::
    System V Semaphores key number. Used for shared memory locking.
    POSIX semaphores are not used here, because they are not unlocked if process
    dies during acquired semaphore. For System V shared memory IPCKEY+*0..5*
    different keys may be used for shared memory. For System V semaphores IPCKEY+*0..2*
    range is used.
*NDRX_MSGMAX*='MAX_MSGS_PER_QUEUE'::
    Posix queue config attrib. Max number of messages that can be put in one queue.
*NDRX_DQMAX*='NDRXD_ACCESS_Q_MSG_MAX'::
    Enduro/X ATMI daemoni 'ndrxd' access Q size. Bigger is better.
*NDRX_MSGSIZEMAX*='NDRXD_ACCESS_Q_MSG_MAX'::
    Max message size (in bytes). The value is limited to the operating system limits
    of the maximums size of the POSIX queues message size. For example on Linux 
    kernel 3.13 it is possible to set message size to 10 Megabytes. Also the message
    size denotes the internal buffer sizes for XATMI message processing. As mostly
    for all operations Enduro/X uses stack allocation for the buffers, this means
    that there are requirements for the application stack sizes. Thus the stack
    size must be 30 times the size of the message. For example if message size
    is set to 64KB, then stack size must be at least 1920KB (~2MB). Otherwise application
    will not start. If message size max is set to less than 64KB, then buffer size
    is defaulted to 64KB.
    This parameter also affects the opening/creation of the message queue. As the
    message size is specified in mq_open() attributes.
*NDRX_APPHOME*='FULL_PATH_TO_APPDOMAIN_INSTANCE_DIR'::
    This is full path to application (not an Enduro/X directory it self) root directory.
*NDRX_HOME*='FULL_PATH_TO_ENDUROX_ROOT_DIRECTORY'::
    Full path to Enduro/X installaction directory.
*NDRX_DEBUG_CONF*='FULL_PATH_TO_DEBUG_CONFIG_FILE'::
    This sets full path to debug configuration file.
*NDRX_UBFMAXFLDS*='MAX_NUMBER_OF_UBFFIELDS'::
    Max number of UBF fields. Used for hashing. Bigger number is better. 
    The max number is number is 33554432 (25 bit).
*NDRX_DMNLOG*='FULL_PATH_TO_NDRX_DMNLOG'::
	The full path to 'ndrxd' log file. Used by shell scripts.
*NDRX_DMNLEV*='LOG_LEVEL_OF_NDRXD'::
    Log level of 'ndrxd'. From 1..5. 5 is max. Used by shell scripts.
*NDRX_LOG*='FULL_PATH_TO_XADMIN_LOG_FILE'::
    Full path to 'xadmin' log file. Used by shell scripts.
*NDRX_LEV*='LOG_LEVEL_OF_XADMIN'::
    Log level of 'xadmin'. From 1..5. 5 is max. Used by shell scripts.
*NDRX_XA_RES_ID*='XA_RESOURCE_ID'::
    XA API two phase commit resource id.
    Must be set if using distributed transactions. Valid value is in range
    of 1..255.
*NDRX_XA_OPEN_STR*='XA_OPEN_STRING'::
    This is open string for two phase commit XA driver.
    Must be set if using distributed transactions.
*NDRX_XA_CLOSE_STR*='XA_CLOSE_STRING'::
    This is close string for two phase commit XA driver. This is optional, 
    'NDRX_XA_OPEN_STR' will be used if not set.
*NDRX_XA_DRIVERLIB*='ENDUROX_XA_DRIVER_LIB'::
    This is full path to Enduro/X shared library which loads the XA api.
*NDRX_XA_RMLIB*='RESOURCE_MANAGER_SPECIFIC_DRIVER'::
    This is full path to resource manager's specific driver (shared library).
    Must be set if using distributed transactions.
*NDRX_XA_LAZY_INIT*='LAZY_INIT_FLAG'::
    Set to '1' if XA sub-system should be initialized on first transactions. 
    If not set, then defaulted to '0', meaning initialize XA sub-system on 
    executable startup.
*NDRX_XA_FLAGS*='XADMIN_XA_FLAGS'::
    Special for XA sub-system. It is semicolon separated tags with values.
    currently tags 'RECON', 'NOJOIN' and 'NOSTARTXID' are defined.
    'RECON' tag defines the number of attempts
    of xa_close()/xa_open() and doing xa_start() again in case if original
    xa_start() failed (the ATMI call tpbegin()) - for example firewall have been 
    closed the connection. The format for the tag is:
    'RECON:<comma separated list of error codes e.g. 4,-8,* - any err>:<number 
    of attempts>:<sleep between attempts milli-sec>'
    example: 'RECON:*:3:100', meaning reconnect on any xa_start error, do the
    3x attempts, sleep 100 milliseconds between attempts.
    With 'NOJOIN' indicates that XA Switch does not support 'TMJOIN' mode.
    With 'NOSTARTXID' indicates that transaction session does not start with
    identifier, but only when process disconnects from transaction, it is possible
    to give transaction id for work which has been done to database.
*NDRX_NRSEMS*='NDRX_NRSEMS'::
    Number of semaphores used for protecting shared memory, when Enduro/X 
    running in 'poll()' mode. The minimum is recommended something about 7. 
    Every service name in shared memory is hashed and semaphore protecting 
    the service is calculated by modulus of NRSEMS. This affects 'NDRX_IPCKEY' 
    semaphore, by giving the more occurrences in array. The first array entry 
    is used by normal Enduro/X operations, and the others 2..1+NRSEMS is 
    used by 'poll()' mode service protection. Default value is 30.
*NDRX_MAXSVCSRVS*='NDRX_MAXSVCSRVS'::
    Max number of servers can advertise same service. This is used only in 
    'poll()' and 'SystemV' mode.
    The number affects the size of shared memory used for services. Bigger number causes
    more memory to be used for service registry. If the number of servers goes over this number
    for one service, the service entry will be ignored. Default is *30*.
*PATH='PATH'*::
    This is not Enduro/X specific env variable. But Enduro/X distribution bin 
    directory should be included in system PATH env. variable.
*FLDTBLDIR*='FULL_OR_RELATIVE_PATH_OF_UBF_FIELD_DIRS'::
    This is colon separated list of directories where .fd files are located. I.e. UBF field definitions.
*FIELDTBLS*='COMMA_SEPERATED_LIST_OF_FIELD_FILES'::
    This is comma separated list of field files found in FLDTBLDIR.
*NDRX_CCONFIG*='NDRX_COMMON_CONFIG_FILE'::
    If this is set then, all above configuration is read from specified ini
    file in 'NDRX_COMMON_CONFIG_FILE' in [@global] section. The Enduro/X config
    driving unit is able to merge configuration from multiple config files,
    and you can set higher priority files by in 'NDRX_CCONFIG1', 'NDRX_CCONFIG2'
    'NDRX_CCONFIG3', 'NDRX_CCONFIG4', 'NDRX_CCONFIG5'. Basically 'NDRX_CCONFIG'
    is lowest priority and 'NDRX_CCONFIG5' is highest priority. The specified
    configuration file can be directory, in that case Enduro/X will search for
    files with mask *.ini, *.cfg, *.conf, *.config files. All will be loaded
    in alphabetical order.
*NDRX_CCTAG*='NDRX_COMMON_CONFIG_TAG'::
    This is basically subsection used for Enduro/X configuration sections
    [@global], [@debug], [@queue]. If the variable is set, then Enduro/X will
    lookup at process startup for sections like [@global/YOUR_TAG], etc. CC tag
    can contain multiple sections, for example 'server1/RM2'. Enduro/X will lookup
    the variables in each section [@global/server1] and [@global/RM2] for setting
    up the system.
*NDRX_XADMIN_CONFIG*='XADMIN_CONFIG_FILE'::
    This variable is used by *xadmin* read the specific configuration file with
    xadmin's settings. Variable is optional.
*HOME*='UNIX_USER_HOME_DIR'::
    This variable is used by *xadmin* to search for per user configuration file
    when xadmin is started. In home directory search for configuration is done
    by $HOME/.xadmin.config. This file is used in case if 'NDRX_XADMIN_CONFIG'
    is missing. Variable is optional.
*VIEWDIR*='NDRX_VIEW_DIR'::
    This is colon separated list of directories where to search VIEW compiled
    object files. The access to these directories are done only once operations
    with views are performed.
*VIEWFILES*='NDRX_VIEW_FILES'::
    Comma separated list of VIEW object files (typically with extension .V).
    Object files are produced by view compiler *viewc(8)*.
*NDRX_PLUGINS*='NDRX_PLUGINS'::
    This is semicolon separated string which denotes the list Enduro/X
    plugins which needs to be loaded at any XATMI program startup. Following plugins
    are provided with Enduro/X: libcryptohost.so - cryptography key by hostname.
*NDRX_SILENT*='SILENT_SETTING'::
    If environment variable is present (and set to *Y*), the *xadmin* tool
    will not print banner header at startup.
*NDRX_XADMINTOUT*='XADMIN_TOUT'::
    This override of 'NDRX_TOUT' configuration for xadmin queue operations.
    This timeout is used for certain calls to *ndrxd* (for example startup,
    shutdown, service listing, etc). Also it is used for communication
    with XATMI servers like *cpmsrv* and *tmsrv*. This is number of seconds,
    the value must be greater than 0. If parameter is set, then this will
    enable timeout control for communication with *ndrxd* daemon, if parameter
    is not set, the code will work in legacy mode, meaning that list calls
    to ndrxd will never get timeout.
*NDRX_SVPROCNAME*='SERVER_PROC_NAME'::
    Server process name exported by *ndrxd* at XATMI server process boot time.
    The name is either server name extracted by "<server>" or extracted by sub
    tag "<cmdline>".
*NDRX_SVCLOPT*='SERVER_COMMAND_LINE'::
    Server process command line. Generated and exported at the moment of XATMI
    server boot. If no command line options are passed to XATMI server, then
    *libatmisrv* tries to extract the parameter from this environment variable
    before failing, due to missing command line arguments.
*NDRX_SVPPID*='SERVER_PARENT_PID'::
    Parent process PID of server process. This process basically is the one
    which is booted by *ndrxd*. In case if server definition contains some
    wrapper processes (or scripts), then this basically is different than value
    of the real XATMI server. This variable is used by XATMI server library
    to report both PIDs to the *ndrxd*, the parent PID and the real process PID.
*NDRX_SVSRVID*='SERVER_PROCESS_ID'::
    This is XATMI server id set in '<srvid>' tag. The variable can be used
    for example is wrapper scripts to modify some resources used by process.
    For example if booting something like Tomcat app server, the admin TCP ports
    can be adjusted by this environment variable in order to avoid conflicts for
    booting multiple instances.
*NDRX_SVQREADERSMAX*='MAX_SIMULTANEOUS_READERS'::
    This configuration parameter set the maximum parallel readers for System V
    to Posix queues mapping tables. The number is used for read-write locks,
    thus the number sets the simultaneous readers, but during that time the
    write thread needs to wait for all readers to finish up the mapping when
    the writer will step in and all readers will wait. If the number is bigger
    read will be performed better when many processes are used, but that could
    lead to write starvation, and writes (opening queues) may become slow.
    System V queues acquires one more semaphore resource from the *NDRX_IPCKEY*+1.
    Thus this semaphore is used read/write mode to protect the SystemV-to-Posix
    and Posix-to-SystemV mapping tables.
    The default value for this parameter is *50*.
*NDRX_MSGQUEUESMAX*='MAX_IPC_QUEUES'::
    Max number of queues that can be mapped to System V sub-system. This parameter
    defines size for two shared memory chunks which names are '<NDRX_QPREFIX>,shm,p2s'
    and '<NDRX_QPREFIX>,shm,s2p'. The number defines number of queue entries in
    the table. The bigger the number, the better hashing is got and lookup is
    quicker, but more memory is used. The minimum number shall be equal to the
    number of queues that will be used on the system, but recommended number is
    something as twice it. Each queue entry requires about 168 bytes.
    The default value for this parameter is *20000*.
*NDRX_CLTTAG*='CLIENT_PROCESS_TAG'::
    This is client process tag exported to *cpmsrv(8)* controlled processes.
    This value can be used also in *ndrxconfig.xml(5)*
    when formatting client process command line and log file names.

*NDRX_CLTSUBSECT*='CLIENT_PROCESS_TAG'::
    This is client process tag's sub-section exported to *cpmsrv(8)* 
    controlled processes. This value can be used also in *ndrxconfig.xml(5)*
    when formatting client process command line and log file names.

*NDRX_LIBEXT*='SHARED_LIB_EXTENSION'::
    This is shared library platform specific extension. For example Linux/AIX and
    Solaris would use "so". For MacOS it would be "dylib". Env variable is
    generated by provision script and it set in global variables. 

*NDRX_NORMWAITMAX*='NORM_WAIT_ATTEMPTS'::
    This configures number of attempts for *xadmin(8)* (and *tpadmsv(8)*) commands
    to wait in case if command requires normal *ndrxd(8)* context, but process
    is in other context, for example starting or stopping. The default is *60*.
    Between each attempt 1 second sleep is done.

*NDRX_FPAOPTS*='POOL_MALLOC_OPTS'::
    This flag allows configures Enduro/X Fast Pool Allocator. Pool Allocator is
    mechanism in Enduro/X core libraries to avoid calls to malloc() and free()
    system calls. Instead for memory block of sizes *256*, *512*, *1024*, *2048*, *4096*
    and *S* ( *NDRX_MSGSIZEMAX* - system buffer) are allocated and cached 
    (stored in linked list) when parked free. Thus
    at certain points Enduro/X requests for memory different sizes from FPA, the
    FPA library finds the first suitable size (may be bigger than request) and
    block is removed from list. When program does free the block, FPA returns it
    to linked list instead of freeing back to the system. Thus from OS perspective
    memory is still used. For each of the block sizes maximum number 
    stored blocks are configured. The configuration is written
    in following form '<block_size>:<stored_count>,...,<block_size_N>:<stored_count_N>'.
    There is also defined special block size *D*. This means default. By setting
    this values, counts are changed for all sizes.
    The stored count can be set in value of *1*..*max_int*. 
    If set to special value *M*, then standard, then malloc is used directly. 
    It is error to have other non valid number as count. If block
    size is not found then system, the userlog message is added, but error is
    not generated. The block sizes supports suffix *K* which multiplies
    the value by *1024*. Default value is  *256:25,512:15,1K:10,2K:10,4K:10,S:10*.
    User might adjust these buffer sizes for multi-threaded apps, especially
    the system buffer (*S*). By increasing the numbers, there is higher possibility
    that process will permanently use more memory.

*NDRX_THREADSTACKSIZE*='STACKS_SIZE_IN_KB'::
    This is target stack size for new threads produced by Enduro/X. If value
    is not specified, then threads produced by Enduro/X are configured by
    stack size which is set for the program main thread (i.e. current resource
    limit). If the limit is set to unlimited, then Enduro/X sets thread stack
    size to *8192* (which is 8 megabytes).

*NDRX_SCANUNIT*='SYSVTOUT_THREAD_SCAN_WAIT_MS'::
    This flag is used by *SystemV* polling configuration, for others modes like 
    *epoll*, *poll*, *kqueue*, *emq*, *svapoll* it is not used. The flag indicates
    how long time is spent (in milliseconds) on waits between scanning for 
    System-V timeouts. The default value is *1000* and minimum is *1*.
