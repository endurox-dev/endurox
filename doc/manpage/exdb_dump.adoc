EXDB_DUMP(8)
============
:doctype: manpage


NAME
----
exdb_dump - LMDB/NDRXDB environment export tool


SYNOPSIS
--------
*exdb_dump* [*-V*] [*-f* 'file'] [*-l*] [*-n*] [*-p*] [*-a* | *-s* 'subdb']  'envpath'


OPTIONS
-------

[*-V*]:: 
Write the library version number to the standard output, and exit.

[*-f*]:: 'file'
Write to the specified file instead of to the standard output.

[*-l*]::
List the databases stored in the environment. Just the names will be listed, 
no data will be output.

[*-n*]::
Dump an NDRXDB database which does not use subdirectories.

[*-p*]::
If  characters in either the key or data items are printing characters 
(as defined by isprint(3)), output them directly. This option permits users to 
use standard text editors and tools to modify the contents of databases.

*Note*: different systems may have different notions about what characters are 
considered printing characters, and databases dumped in this manner 
may be less portable to external systems.

[*-a*]::
Dump all of the subdatabases in the environment.

[*-s*]:: 'subdb'
Dump a specific subdatabase. If no database is specified, only the main 
database is dumped.


EXIT STATUS
-----------
Exit status is zero if no errors occur. Errors result in a non-zero exit 
status and a diagnostic message being written to standard error.

Dumping and reloading databases that use user-defined comparison 
functions will result in new databases that use the default comparison functions.  
In this case it is quite likely that the reloaded database will  be  damaged
beyond repair permitting neither record storage nor retrieval.

The only available workaround is to modify the source for the 
exdb_load(1) utility to load the database using the correct comparison functions.
