SYNOPSIS
--------
*xadmin* ['COMMAND'] ['OPTIONS']


DESCRIPTION
-----------
'xadmin' is command line interface to EnduroX. It is administration utility.
Which is servers as communication interface between EnduroX ATMI local daemon
and administrator. 'xadmin' can receive commands as parameter to 'xadmin'. It
can read command from pipe (stdin). And it can work in interactive mode. In this
case 'xadmin' is started with no paramters.

'xadmin' is responsible to start idle instance of 'ndrxd'. After that 'xadmin'
sends commands to 'ndrxd' and prints the response from daemon to the stdout in
human readable form. Commands are sent and response from 'ndrxd' are received
via POSIX Queues.
