DESCRIPTION
-----------
This library may be used with Enduro/X in case if binaries are built with 
build commands such as *buildserver(8)*, *buildclient(8)* or *buildtms(8)* 
and XA Switch is build with the binary. The XA Switch symbol name is configured 
in *$NDRX_RMFILE* (first priority) or *$NDRX_HOME/udataobj/RM* and then by name
set for build commands.

As Enduro/X uses dynamic load libraries to resolve XA configuration with help
of the adapter loaders, to use the buil-in symbol, a loader library is needed.
Thus libndrxxatmsx provides this interface, and if configured for transaction
group, will resolve XA switch which was compiled with the build commands.

In case if libndrxxatmsx driver is used with binaries which haven't built with
build commands, the NULL switch ('tmnull_switch' is used, which is dummy XA switch
it says OK for all XA commands). In case if for servers *libatmisrvinteg* is
used and switch name is not passed to _tmstartserver(), the loader will raise
error, instead of using null switch. In that case, *libndrxxanulls(8)* loader
shall be used.
