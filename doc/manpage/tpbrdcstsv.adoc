This is special ATMI system process which is started in standard way by
'ndrxd' process application server boot. The server process is used for remote
cluster node notification and broadcast dispatching in local application domain.

notification is delivered to local machine, the notification firstly is sent to

Multiple copies of the server process can be started, in order to load balance
the notification dispatching.
