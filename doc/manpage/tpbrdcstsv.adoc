DESCRIPTION
-----------
This is special ATMI system process which is started in standard way by
'ndrxd' process application server boot. The server process is used for remote
cluster node notification and broadcast dispatching in local application domain.
When remote machine issues *tpnotify(3)* or *tpbroadcast(3)* command and the
notification is delivered to local machine, the notification firstly is sent to
*tpbrdcstsv*. Then *tpbrdcstsv*, service 'TPBROADNNN' (where NNN - is local
cluster node id) dispatches the notification/broadcast to the local app domain.
Multiple copies of the server process can be started, in order to load balance
the notification dispatching.
