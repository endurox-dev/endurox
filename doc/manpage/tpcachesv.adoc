NAME
----
tpcachesv - Enduro/X real time cache management server

SYNOPSIS
--------
*tpcachesv*


DESCRIPTION
-----------
This is special XATMI server used for supporting the cluster operations
when receiving event of message adding or removing from other cluster nodes.
Also this server is backend for command line tools such as 'xadmin cs' (cache
show), 'xadmin cd' (cache dump) and 'xadmin ci' (cache invalidate).

For cluster operations, cache server subscribes to events specified in 'subscr'
parameter for database. Per cluster node service name are fixed. Thus servers
shall be booted with all CC tags set, so that it would have a visibility of
all databases. Full visibility is required for command line tools processing
and incoming event processing. Multiple copies of server can be booted. They 
all will subscribe to same events. The *tpevsrv* will ensure the single event
delivery to the same service name.

During the event processing, following events can be consumed (by regexp mask
they can be combined):

. @CPNNN/F*/S+ - event is received if new data is put to cache. The data buffer
includes full message which is being cached. The data which is written to cache
is 

. @CDNNN/F*/S+ - event is received when data is being deleted from cache. The
data delete can be generated either from *tpcached* (when record reaches limit,
expires or service is not available. In this case full or subset of message
is broadcasted (according to 'delete' parameter of service cache definition). The
delete message is processed according to local cache definition. Service is found
and then record is matched according to rules. This event also can be received
in cases when "invalidate their" cache is used.
 
. @CKNNN/F*/D+ - drop (kill) the database. This event is published when from
xadmin tool *xadmin ci -d D+", the database is being dropped. The event notification
contains NULL buffer. The 'D+' is database name. Note that in case of
keygroup (group db and key item db) there no linkage. So drop will clean
up the database specified, and not any linked.

. @CMNNN/F+/D+ - delete database (D+) records by regular expression mask
over the cached keys. The data buffer send with this event is *UBF* typed,
which contains one field 'EX_CACHE_OPEXPR' - regular expression mask to
match keys with. If key is matched, then record is deleted.

. @CENNN/F+/D+ - delete records by key. The database name is encoded in 'D+'.
The key to delete is encoded in event buffer, which is *UBF* typed. Field
'EX_CACHE_OPEXPR' keeps the key to delete. Before deleting record, it is
read from database. The flags are checked for record. If record is part
of the keygroup and it is keyitem. Then data buffer is recovered from data
and group key is built. Key group is updated (key removed) and key item
is removed.
