NAME
----
ud - UBF Dump.


SYNOPSIS
--------
*ud*


DESCRIPTION
-----------
This is command line utility used for sending UBF buffer to service specified in field 'SRVCNM' in buffer.
Buffer is read from 'stdin'. The result is printed back to 'stdout'.

For example servce call could look like:
--------------------------------------------------
$ ud < unix.ud 2>/dev/null 
SENT pkt(1) is :
SRVCNM	UNIXINFO

RTN pkt(1) is :
SRVCNM	UNIXINFO
T_STRING_FLD	Linux znaroks 2.6.23-gentoo-r6 #9...
T_STRING_FLD	 13:55:10 up 749 days, 19:46,  0...
T_STRING_FLD	Linux mailsrv 2.6.21-xen #2 SMP...
T_STRING_FLD	 13:55:11 up 97 days, 22:34,  0...
--------------------------------------------------

Where 'unix.ud' file consists of following lines:

--------------------------------------------------
SRVCNM	UNIXINFO
--------------------------------------------------

In this case only one field is present (which is service name to be called). But file might contain
as many as needed fields.

Fields must be seperated by tab character (i.e. field name and value).
Extended syntax for 'ud' buffers are supported, like lines starting with:

* + Means change fields value
* - Delete field
* = Copy value from other field.
* # Comment
