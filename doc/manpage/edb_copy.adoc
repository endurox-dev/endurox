EDB_COPY(8)
===========
:doctype: manpage

NAME
----
edb_dump - LMDB/EXDB environment copy tool


SYNOPSIS
--------
*edb_copy* [*-V*] [*-c*] [*-n*] *srcpath* [*dstpath*]


DESCRIPTION
-----------

The *edb_copy* utility copies an EXDB environment. The environment can be 
copied regardless of whether it is currently in use. No lockfile is created, 
since it gets recreated at need.

If 'dstpath' is specified it must be the path of an empty directory for 
storing the backup. Otherwise, the backup will be written to stdout.

OPTIONS
-------

[*-V*]::
Write the library version number to the standard output, and exit.

[*-c*]::
Compact while copying. Only current data pages will be copied; 
freed or unused pages will be omitted from the copy. 
This option will slow down the backup process as it is more CPU-intensive.
Currently it fails if the environment has suffered a page leak.

[*-n*]::
Open LDMB environment(s) which do not use subdirectories.

EXIT STATUS
-----------
Exit status is zero if no errors occur. Errors result in a non-zero exit 
status and a diagnostic message being written to standard error.

----
