DESCRIPTION
-----------
Enduro/X supports tpcall(3) caching, by writing results into LMDB. LMDB is
integral par to of the Enduro/X. To avoid conflict with users choice of LMDB
version, the embedded version is renamed to "EXDB", so that global C symbols
does not conflict. To configure Enduro/x tpcall caching, firstly database must
be configured. Enduro/X uses approach, that each database is stored into separate
file system directory. On Linux systems (or others which support RAM drivers),
the directory can be defined in RAM drive, and thus avoid the cache writing to
disk (as the LMDB uses memory mapped files). On Linux for this purpose /dev/shm
can be used.

Caching is performed at service level. Thus when software is doing *tpcall(3)*,
the client's call is intercepted, and tested against cache. If saved data is
found, then data is directly returned from LMDB and no service invocation is done.

Each cached item must have a key. The key is build from the call data. Key is zero
(0x00 byte) terminated string. Key format is given in cache configuration. Before
lookup to DB is made, rule expression is tested. This indicates either the call
must be cached or not. If rule is true, key is built and with key DB is tested,
if result is found, it is returned to caller. If result is not found, then service
invocation is performed. When service responds, data is written to cache.

Service can have multiple caches, with different rules. Once request is processed
the first cache which matches the rule is used for lookup or data saving.

Each cache references database definition, single database can be use by multiple
caches or each cache can have it's own database. Keeping multiple databases
could make better performance for caches were often writes are done. As concurrent
writes are synchronized so that only one process writes to the same database.

If writing to the same database, user shall ensure that keys are unique between
different service cache definitions. This can be reached by adding different
prefixes in key format.

DEFINITIONS
-----------

*Simple cache* - this is cache were data is saved in one cache database. No
linked databases are used.

*Keygroup* is separate database where records can be grouped. For example 
by user id. The group record holds the *UBF* buffer with string key occurrences
which are linked in the group. Keygroup database name is encoded as 

*Keyitem* is linked record to the group.


DATABASE DEFINITION
-------------------

*DBNAME_SECTION*::
    In case of simple database. This is a name of the database. For example
    "cachedb1". Allowed symbols a-z, A-Z, 0-9. In case of keygroup or keyitems
    databases, format for section is "<dbname>/<logical_db_name>. For the caches
    the db names are encoded as "<logical_db_name>@<dbname>". Parameter is
    *mandatory*.
*DBNAME_DB*::
    This is database name. For simple caches, name must be the same as 
    *DBNAME_SECTION*. For keygroup or keyitems databases name format is
    "<logical_db_name>@<dbname>". Parameter is *mandatory*.
*DATABASE_DIRECTORY*::
    This is file system directory where cache database is located. The directory
    must exist when application domain is started. In case of keygroup 
    and keyitems databases, the directory must be the same.
    Parameter is *mandatory*.
*FLAGS*::
    This is comma separated list of keywords - flags. See next section for list
    of flags supported for cache db.
*LIMIT*::
    If number of cached items in database must be limited (for example 1000 recs
    max), then the number is defined by this parameter. If this parameter is set
    then one of the following flags must be present *fifo*, *lru* or *hits* - 
    delete strategy. So that *tpcached(8)* process would know how to sort and
    which records to remove. The limit is not guaranteed maximum. As records are
    removed by *tpcached* daemon, there could be times that limit is overreached,
    because *tpcached* works with periods. And during the sleep time, more records
    could be added to db and only after sleep period *tpcached* will zap them.
*MAX_READERS*::
    See LMDB documentation for this. Basically this is number of threads used
    by process. See LMDB's mdb_env_set_maxreaders() function description. The
    default value set by Enduro/X is *64*.
*NDRXD_RESTART_TO_CHECK*::
    Number of *seconds* for 'ndrxd' to wait after daemon started in recovery
    mode. Within this time no sanity checks are perfomed, but instead "learning" mode
    is used. During this mode, 'ndrxd' asks each ATMI server for it's configuration.
    If in this time ATMI server does not responds, then ATMI server is subject
    of sanity checks.

DATABASE FLAGS
--------------
*NDRXD_GATHER_PQ_STATS*::
    Settings for *pq* 'xadmin' command. if set to 'Y', ndrxd will automatically collect
    stats for service queues. In future this might be used for automatic service starting
    and stopping.
*MIN_SERVERS_DEFAULT*::
    Default minimum number of copies of the server which needs to be started automatically.
    This can be overridden by 'MIN_SERVERS_SRV' per server.
*MAX_SERVERS_DEFAULT*::
    Max number of ATMI server copies per ATMI server entry. The difference between
    MIN and MAX servers means the number of standby servers configured. They can be started
    by hand with out system re-configuration. But they are not booted automatically at
    system startup. You will have to start them with $ xadmin start -s <server_name>
    or by $ xadmin start -i <server_id>. This can be overridden by
    'MAX_SERVERS_SRV'.
*AUTOKILL_DEFAULT*::
    Should server be automatically killed (by sequence signal sequence 
    -2, -15, -9) in case if server have been starting up too long, or
    does not respond to pings too long, or it is performing shutdown
    too long. This can be overridden by 'AUTOKILL_SRV' on per server
    basis.
*ENV_OVERRIDE_DEFAULT*::
    Full path to file containing environment variable overrides.
    see 'ex_envover(5)' for more details. This can be overridden
    by per server basis by ENV_OVERRIDE_SRV. 
    Both are optional settings.

CACHE DEFINITION
----------------

*MAX_STARTUP_TIME_DEFAULT*::
    Max time (in sanity units) in which server should start up, i.e. send init info to
    'ndrxd'. If during this time server have not initialized, it is being restarted. This
    can be overridden by 'MAX_STARTUP_TIME_SRV'.
*PING_EVERY_TIME_DEFAULT*::
    Number of sanity units in which perform periodical server pings. This can be
    overridden by 'PING_EVERY_TIME_SRV'. Zero value disables ping.
*MAX_PING_TIME_DEFAULT*::
    Number of sanity units, time in which server *must* respond to ping requests.
    If there is no response from server within this time, then restart sequence is
    initiated. This can be overridden by 'MAX_PING_TIME_SRV'.
*MAX_SERVER_SHUTDOWN_TIME_DEFAULT*::
    Maximum time in which shutdown of server must complete in sanity units.
    If in given time server is not shutdown, then forced shutdown sequence
    is started until server exits. This can be overridden by 'MAX_SERVER_SHUTDOWN_TIME_SRV'
    on per server basis.
*EXPORT_SERVICES_DEFAULT*::
    Comma separated list of services to be applied to all binaries which means the list of
    services to be exported by *tpbridge* server to other cluster node. This can be overridden by 
    'ATMI_SERVER_EXPORT_SERVICES'.
*BLACKLIST_SERVICES_DEFAULT*::
    Comma separated list of services to be applied to all server binaries which means the list of
    services that must not be exported by *tpbridge* server to other cluster node.
    'ATMI_SERVER_BLACKLIST_SERVICES' is first priority over the 'EXPORT_SERVICES_DEFAULT' if
    service appears in both lists. 'BLACKLIST_SERVICES_DEFAULT' can be overridden by 
    'ATMI_SERVER_BLACKLIST_SERVICES'. 
*NDRXD_SRV_START_WAIT_DEFAULT*::
    Number of seconds to wait for servers to boot. If not started in given time,
    then continue with next server. This can be overridden by 'NDRXD_SRV_START_WAIT'.
    Default value for this is 30 seconds.
*NDRXD_SRV_STOP_WAIT_DEFAULT*::
    Number of seconds to wait for server to shutdown. If not started in given time,
    then continue with next server. This can be overridden by 'NDRXD_SRV_STOP_WAIT_DEFAULT'.
    Default value for this is 30 seconds.
*KILL_TIME_DEFAULT*::
    Time in sanity units after which to progress from first signal -2 to next signal
    -15. And after -15 this time means when next -9 signal will be sent. This is used
    if forced restart of forced shutdown was initiated by 'ndrxd'. This
    can be overridden by 'KILL_TIME_SRV'.
*COMMON_CONFIG_TAG_DEFAULT*::
    Common configuration tag. Loaded into 'NDRX_CCTAG' environment variable before
    process is spawned. This can be overridden by 'COMMON_CONFIG_TAG'.
*PROTECTED_SERVER_DEFAULT*::
    Protected server is one that does not shutdown with 'xadmin stop' unless you pass the
    'xadmin stop -c' paramter (complete shutdown). Still you can run the 'sreload' and 
    stop it by 'xadmin stop -i <srvid>' or by 'xadmin stop -s <servernm>'. The 'xadmin restart'
    won't work on these because '-c' is not supposed to be used by restart.
    The idea behind this, is to avoid accidental stop of the critical servers, like bridge or
    something else which is involved into 'ndrxd' daemon management it self.
    This can be overridden by 'PROTECTED_SERVER'.

CACHE FLAGS
-----------
*RELOAD_ON_CHANGE_DEFAULT*::
    If set to *Y* or *y* the *ndrxd* daemon will scan the every binaries time stamp,
    and if it detects that time stamp is changed *ndrxd* will reload (stop/start)
    the XATMI servers one by one. The scanning will occur at every sanity
    cycle. This is recommended to be used *only* for development purposes. And
    must not be used on production servers! 
    This can be overridden by 'RELOAD_ON_CHANGE_SERVER' on per server basis.
*SECONDS_TO_SLEEP_AFTER_SRV_START*::
    Number of seconds to wait for next item to start after the server is launched.
    This is useful in cases when for example we start bridge server, let it for some
    seconds to connect to other node, then continue with other service startup.
*SERVER_BINARY_NAME*::
    ATMI server executable's name. The executable must be in $PATH.
    This name cannot contain special symbols like path seperator '/'
    and it cannot contains commas ','! Commas are used as internal
    queue seperator combined with binary names.
