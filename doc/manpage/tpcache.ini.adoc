DESCRIPTION
-----------
Enduro/X supports tpcall(3) caching, by writing results into LMDB. LMDB is
integral par to of the Enduro/X. To avoid conflict with users choice of LMDB
version, the embedded version is renamed to "EXDB", so that global C symbols
does not conflict. To configure Enduro/x tpcall caching, firstly database must
be configured. Enduro/X uses approach, that each database is stored into separate
file system directory. On Linux systems (or others which support RAM drivers),
the directory can be defined in RAM drive, and thus avoid the cache writing to
disk (as the LMDB uses memory mapped files). On Linux for this purpose /dev/shm
can be used.

Caching is performed at service level. Thus when software is doing *tpcall(3)*,
the client's call is intercepted, and tested against cache. If saved data is
found, then data is directly returned from LMDB and no service invocation is done.

Each cached item must have a key. The key is build from the call data. Key is zero
(0x00 byte) terminated string. Key format is given in cache configuration. Before
lookup to DB is made, rule expression is tested. This indicates either the call
must be cached or not. If rule is true, key is built and with key DB is tested,
if result is found, it is returned to caller. If result is not found, then service
invocation is performed. When service responds, data is written to cache.

Service can have multiple caches, with different rules. Once request is processed
the first cache which matches the rule is used for lookup or data saving.

Each cache references database definition, single database can be use by multiple
caches or each cache can have it's own database. Keeping multiple databases
could make better performance for caches were often writes are done. As concurrent
writes are synchronized so that only one process writes to the same database.

If writing to the same database, user shall ensure that keys are unique between
different service cache definitions. This can be reached by adding different
prefixes in key format.

DEFINITIONS
-----------

*Simple cache* - this is cache were data is saved in one cache database. No
linked databases are used.

*Keygroup* is separate database where records can be grouped. For example 
by user id. The group record holds the *UBF* buffer with string key occurrences
which are linked in the group. Keygroup database name is encoded as 

*Keyitem* is linked record to the group.


DATABASE DEFINITION
-------------------

*DBNAME_SECTION*::
    In case of simple database. This is a name of the database. For example
    "cachedb1". Allowed symbols a-z, A-Z, 0-9. In case of keygroup or keyitems
    databases, format for section is "<dbname>/<logical_db_name>. For the caches
    the db names are encoded as "<logical_db_name>@<dbname>". Parameter is
    *mandatory*.
*DBNAME_DB*::
    This is database name. For simple caches, name must be the same as 
    *DBNAME_SECTION*. For keygroup or keyitems databases name format is
    "<logical_db_name>@<dbname>". Parameter is *mandatory*.
*DATABASE_DIRECTORY*::
    This is file system directory where cache database is located. The directory
    must exist when application domain is started. In case of keygroup 
    and keyitems databases, the directory must be the same.
    Parameter is *mandatory*.
*FLAGS*::
    This is comma separated list of keywords - flags. See next section for list
    of flags supported for cache db.
*LIMIT*::
    If number of cached items in database must be limited (for example 1000 recs
    max), then the number is defined by this parameter. If this parameter is set
    then one of the following flags must be present *fifo*, *lru* or *hits* - 
    delete strategy. So that *tpcached(8)* process would know how to sort and
    which records to remove. The limit is not guaranteed maximum. As records are
    removed by *tpcached* daemon, there could be times that limit is overreached,
    because *tpcached* works with periods. And during the sleep time, more records
    could be added to db and only after sleep period *tpcached* will zap them.
*EXPIRY*::
    Time specification for record to live in cache. After time is passed, the
    *tpcached* process will zap the record. The configuration is specified as:
    N+s for seconds, (e.g. 20s), N+.D+m for minutes (e.g. 30.5m - 30 min, 30 sec)
    or N+.D+h for hours (e.g 3.5h, will store message for 3 hours and 30 minutes).
*MAX_READERS*::
    See LMDB documentation for this. Basically this is number of threads used
    by process. See LMDB's mdb_env_set_maxreaders() function description. The
    default value set by Enduro/X is *1000*.
*MAP_SIZE*::
    Maximum size of the database in bytes. The size must be multiple of OS page
    size. See LMDB's mdb_env_set_mapsize() function description. The default 
    value used by Enduro/X is *10485760*. Postifx multiplier can be used for
    value in configuration: kK(x1000) mM (x1000'000) gG (x1000'000'000) e.g. 10M.
*MAX_NAMED_DBS*::
    Maximum number of "named" logical databases in given resource. Named DB is
    only uses with "@" syntax, and usually only for keygroups (to keep transactions
    atomic between two DBs). The default value is *2*.
*DB_PERMISSIONS*::
    Octal permissions for map files on file system. The default value is *0664*.

DATABASE FLAGS
--------------
*bootreset*::
    Clean up the cache database when Enduro/X application domain is booting. The
    reset is performed by *tpcachebtsv* binary. Thus this binary must be configured
    in *ndrxconfig.xml(5)*. And it should be one of the first XATMI servers booted.
    The *tpcachetbsv* simple removes database files at boot.
*bcastput*::
    Should process perform broadcast (send event) of putting data in cache. If
    this is set and data is put into cache. This invokes calling *tpevsrv* with
    current tpcall response data buffer. Event is @CPNNN//<SVCNM>. Where NNN is
    cluster node id.
*bcastdel*::
    When cache data is deleted either by invalidate cache or by *tpcached*
    operations, if flag is set, the event is broadcasted to *tpevsrv*. The event
    in case of invalidated is @CDNNN/F/<SVCNM> (which contains the data buffer 
    by which data is deleted. It is buffer which performs invalidate, not 
    the actually stored data. Data is processed by cache's *delete* parameter
    which might limit the data sent for deletion over the event server - in order
    to save some traffic). The NNN is cluster node id which initiates the
    invalidate. The F is flags, in case if is 'G', then whole group is deleted if
    record is part of the keygroup, otherwise 'F' flag (full) is sent.
*timesync*::
    Full path to file containing environment variable overrides.
    see 'ex_envover(5)' for more details. This can be overridden
    by per server basis by ENV_OVERRIDE_SRV. 
    Both are optional settings.
*scandup*::
    Full path to file containing environment variable overrides.
    see 'ex_envover(5)' for more details. This can be overridden
    by per server basis by ENV_OVERRIDE_SRV. 
    Both are optional settings.
*clrnosvc*::
    Clear cache when service for which data is cached, is not advertised anymore
    by any XATMI server. The cleanup is performed by *tpcached*.
*keyitems*::
    This is key-items database. Required flag for keygroup items database pair.
*keygroup*::
    This database is for storing key-groups. Note that when using key-group, both
    keyitems and keygroup must be in the same physical resource. And syntax
    for boths databases must be "<logical_db_name>@<dbname>".

CACHE DEFINITION
----------------
*CACHE_DBNAME*::
    Reference to database name. This must match with chosen storage db *DBNAME_DB*.
*CACHE_FLAGS*::
    Flags of the cache (comma separate of flags for cache). See section bellow for
    flags available.
*TYPE*::
    This is buffer type name for which cache is designed. Currently supported type
    is *UBF*.
*SUBTYPE*::
    This is buffer sub type. For example for *VIEW* buffers this is view name.
    Currently this parameter is reserved for future use.
*RULE*::
    This is buffer type specific expression for defining the rule in which case
    the call shall be cached/cache-looked-up or not. If rule is not specified, then
    by default call is accepted for cache. In case if *TYPE* is UBF, then standard
    boolean expression applies here.
*KEYFMT*::
    This is buffer type specific format. For *UBF* fields this is format string
    which might contain field free text with format of '$(UBF_FIELD)', where 
    given construction will be substituted with UBF field value of field 'UBF_FIELD'.
    For example having 'T_STRING_3_FLD' equal to *ABC* and 'T_STRING_2_FLD' occurrence 2
    equal to  XX' and format string 'SV1$(T_STRING_3_FLD)-$(T_STRING_2_FLD[1])', 
    then key will render as 'SV1ABC-XX'. Key is used to distinguish under which
    record to save the data and how to lookup data into database.
*SAVE*::
    This field specifies how data is saved into cache. It is type specific and
    and flags specific. For *UBF* buffer with flag *putfull* full UBF buffer is
    saved. If flag is not specified and 'SAVE' is set to "*", then full buffer
    is saved too. If flags is not specified, but it is comma separated list of
    *UBF* fields, then only those fields are saved to cache. If flags is set to
    *putrex*, then 'SAVE' field shall contain regular expression which is executed
    on buffer fields (names). The names which matches expression are added to
    cache.
*DELETE*::
    This field specifies field which shall be broadcast to other cluster node
    in case if invalidate their cache is performed. This makes a projection of
    incoming buffer in order to save the traffic. The projected buffer is then
    sent to event server for other cluster node processing. Rules for
    the field syntax is similar to the 'SAVE' parameter.
    For *UBF* buffer with flag *delfull* full UBF buffer is sent in event.
    If flag is not specified and 'SAVE' is set to "*", then full buffer
    is sent too. If flags is not specified, but it is comma separated list of
    *UBF* fields, then only those fields are sent in event. If flags is set to
    *delrex*, then 'DELETE' field shall contain regular expression which is executed
    on buffer fields (names). The names which matches expression are added to
    to buffer which is sent to other cluster node.
*RSPRULE*::
    This is boolean expression with following two fields in buffer *EX_TPERRNO*
    which corresponds to *tperrno* of tpcall() and *EX_TPURCODE* corresponds to
    tpcall() user return code. If *RSPRULE* setting is not present, then cached
    are only successful calls (i.e. EX_TPERRNO==0).
*REFRESHRULE*::
    Optional type specific expression. When performing tpcall(), the saved data
    is returned from cache. In case if this expression is defined, the real service
    call will be performed, even data in cache are present. For *UBF* buffers
    this is boolean expression.
*INVAL_SVC*::
    This is service name if "their" service to be invalidated. When service call
    is performed, this "allows" to intercept the call and when response is recieved
    the other service cache, specified in 'INVAL_SVC' will be reset (removed
    cached data). The key used for data access is build by this invalidate cache
    and not by target 'INVAL_SVC' cache definition. If target cache uses
    *invalkeygrp* flag, then then whole group is invalidated. The group access is
    made by 'KEYGRPDB' and 'KEYGRPFMT'.
    
*INVAL_IDX*::
    Comma separated list of services to be applied to all server binaries which means the list of
    services that must not be exported by *tpbridge* server to other cluster node.
    'ATMI_SERVER_BLACKLIST_SERVICES' is first priority over the 'EXPORT_SERVICES_DEFAULT' if
    service appears in both lists. 'BLACKLIST_SERVICES_DEFAULT' can be overridden by 
    'ATMI_SERVER_BLACKLIST_SERVICES'. 
*KEYGRPDB*::
    Protected server is one that does not shutdown with 'xadmin stop' unless you pass the
    'xadmin stop -c' paramter (complete shutdown). Still you can run the 'sreload' and 
    stop it by 'xadmin stop -i <srvid>' or by 'xadmin stop -s <servernm>'. The 'xadmin restart'
    won't work on these because '-c' is not supposed to be used by restart.
    The idea behind this, is to avoid accidental stop of the critical servers, like bridge or
    something else which is involved into 'ndrxd' daemon management it self.
    This can be overridden by 'PROTECTED_SERVER'.
*KEYGRPFMT*::
    Protected server is one that does not shutdown with 'xadmin stop' unless you pass the
    'xadmin stop -c' paramter (complete shutdown). Still you can run the 'sreload' and 
    stop it by 'xadmin stop -i <srvid>' or by 'xadmin stop -s <servernm>'. The 'xadmin restart'
    won't work on these because '-c' is not supposed to be used by restart.
    The idea behind this, is to avoid accidental stop of the critical servers, like bridge or
    something else which is involved into 'ndrxd' daemon management it self.

*KEYGRPMAXTPERRNO*::
    Protected server is one that does not shutdown with 'xadmin stop' unless you pass the
    'xadmin stop -c' paramter (complete shutdown). Still you can run the 'sreload' and 
    stop it by 'xadmin stop -i <srvid>' or by 'xadmin stop -s <servernm>'. The 'xadmin restart'
    won't work on these because '-c' is not supposed to be used by restart.
    The idea behind this, is to avoid accidental stop of the critical servers, like bridge or

*KEYGRPMAXTPURCODE*::
    Protected server is one that does not shutdown with 'xadmin stop' unless you pass the
    'xadmin stop -c' paramter (complete shutdown). Still you can run the 'sreload' and 
    stop it by 'xadmin stop -i <srvid>' or by 'xadmin stop -s <servernm>'. The 'xadmin restart'
    won't work on these because '-c' is not supposed to be used by restart.

    This can be overridden by 'PROTECTED_SERVER'.
*KEYGROUPMREJ*::
    Protected server is one that does not shutdown with 'xadmin stop' unless you pass the
    'xadmin stop -c' paramter (complete shutdown). Still you can run the 'sreload' and 
    stop it by 'xadmin stop -i <srvid>' or by 'xadmin stop -s <servernm>'. The 'xadmin restart'
    won't work on these because '-c' is not supposed to be used by restart.
    The idea behind this, is to avoid accidental stop of the critical servers, like bridge or

    'xadmin stop -c' paramter (complete shutdown). Still you can run the 'sreload' and 
    stop it by 'xadmin stop -i <srvid>' or by 'xadmin stop -s <servernm>'. The 'xadmin restart'

CACHE FLAGS
-----------
*invalkeygrp*::
    If set to *Y* or *y* the *ndrxd* daemon will scan the every binaries time stamp,
    and if it detects that time stamp is changed *ndrxd* will reload (stop/start)
    the XATMI servers one by one. The scanning will occur at every sanity
    cycle. This is recommended to be used *only* for development purposes. And
    must not be used on production servers! 
    This can be overridden by 'RELOAD_ON_CHANGE_SERVER' on per server basis.
*inval*::
    Number of seconds to wait for next item to start after the server is launched.
