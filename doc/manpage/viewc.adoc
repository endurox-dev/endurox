NAME
----
viewc - View file compiler


SYNOPSIS
--------
*viewc* ['OPTIONS'] viewfile1 viewfile2 ... viewfileN


DESCRIPTION
-----------
*viewc* binary consume view files defined in format specified of *viewfile(5)*.
The view file describes the C structure which can be mapped to *UBF* buffer. The
view file contains also the length of the *STRING* and *CARRAY* fields. Program does
following steps:

. Generates C header file with structures according to the view file

. Calculates machine dependent the C field offset in the memory, calculates field
lengths

To perform offset and size calculation, viewc generates small C program which is
compiled by 'buildclient(8)' Perl script. The generated temporary program is executed
which updates the in-memory read view file. The view file is updated with platform
specific data and the "object-file" is written to disk. The object file basically
corresponds the same *viewfile(5)* format, except that additional meta data for
each of the fields are encoded after the NULL column. Also some meta data are
encoded in view file comments. The "object-file" can be used as original view file
by viewc. In that case viewc will ignore the meta data and will produce new
"object-file". Compiled view file gets extension '.V', the generated header file
in C language mode, gets extension '.h'. If source view file passed in command
line for compilation contains the extension, for output files it is stripped off
and only base name is used for target output files. 

*viewc* must have access to *cc* (C Compiler).

ENVIRONMENT
-----------
*CC*::
Optional environment variable indicating which C compiler to use. If parameter is
not set, the *cc* command is used.

*CFLAGS*::
Optional C flags to be passed to C compiler during the *buildclient* execution.

OPTIONS
-------
[*-L* 'LD_LIBRARY_PATH']::
Additional library path for dynamic libraries. This is needed during the compiled
code execution, so that runtime can load dynamic libraries required by Enduro/X.

[*-b* 'BUILD_FLAGS']::
Additional flags to be passed to 'cc' command line. This can be used to pass
additional include path, library path or libraries it self.

[*-n*]::
Do not process UBF mapping during compilation of the view file. This can be useful
in cases if the environment is not configured during the build time and field
definition files are not accessible at the time.

[*-d* 'OUTPUT_DIRECTOR']::
Optional flag for changing output directory where object file is generated. If
parameter is not set, current directory is used.

[*-C*]::
Reserved for future use.

[*-m* 'LANGUAGE_MODE']::
Language mode for header file generation. Currently defined value is 0 - C lang,
which is default value of the parameter.

[*-h*]::
Print usage.


EXIT STATUS
-----------
*0*::
Success

*1*::
Failure
