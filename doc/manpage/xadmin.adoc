NAME
----
xadmin - Enduro/X Administration command line utility

SYNOPSIS
--------
*xadmin* ['COMMAND'] ['OPTIONS']

DESCRIPTION
-----------
'xadmin' is command line interface to Enduro/X. It is administration utility.
Which is servers as communication interface between Enduro/X ATMI local daemon
and administrator. 'xadmin' can receive commands as parameter to 'xadmin'. It
can read command from pipe (stdin). And it can work in interactive mode. In this
case 'xadmin' is started with no parameters.

'xadmin' is responsible to start idle instance of 'ndrxd'. After that 'xadmin'
sends commands to 'ndrxd' and prints the response from daemon to the stdout in
human readable form. Commands are sent and response from 'ndrxd' are received
via POSIX Queues.

'xadmin' can lookup the configuration (currently used for user specific
generators). The configuration search order is following:

1. INI file by 'NDRX_XADMIN_CONFIG' environment variable. This can also be
a directory. The common-config routines will load all configs (.ini .cfg,
.conf, .config) files.

2. INI file in '$HOME/.xadmin.config';

3. INI file in '/etc/xadmin.config';


COMMANDS
-------
*quit*::
    Quit from command line utility
*q*::
    Alias for quit
*exit*::
    Alias for quit
*echo*::
    Echo text back to terminal
*idle*::
    Enter daemon process in idle state (if not started)
*help*::
    Print help (this output)
*stat*::
    Prints general status information
*poller*::
    Print polling sub-system name i.e. *epoll* - when build is using Linux e-poll 
    sub-system, this allows true one queue multiple server approach to be used.
    *kqueue* - the same benefits as for Linux *epoll* only on BSD platform, 
    *SystemV* - for this build System V queues are used (instead for others Posix
    queues are used). In case of System V still one queue multiple servers are
    available with configuration of request address. *poll* - this is worst mode
    for Enduro/X as only Round Robin message distribution is available for
    dispatching messages to servers. This uses only standard features of Posix
    queues.
    The poller is built in the distribution and cannot be changed via configuration,
    only possible changing is with reinstalling other Enduro/X build.
*ldcf*::
    Load configuration
*start* [-y] [-s <server>] [-i <srvid>]::
    Start application domain. If config not loaded, it loads
    configuration automatically. '-y' means do not ask for confirmation. '-s' means
    ATMI servers binary name to be started, instead of whole application domain.
    '-i' means start specific server instance.
*psc*::
    Print services
*stop* [-y] [-s <server>] [-i <srvid>] [-k]::
    Stop application domain. '-y' means do not ask for confirmation. '-s' means
    ATMI servers binary name to be stopped, instead of whole application domain.
    '-i' means stop specific server instance. '-k' flag will keep 'ndrxd' running,
    and protected servers will not be shutdown.
*sreload* [-y] [-s <server>] [-i <srvid>]::
    Reload application domain - restart server instance by instance.
    Configuration be loaded prior.
    '-y' means do not ask for confirmation. '-s' means ATMI servers binary name 
    to be reloaded, instead of whole application domain.
    '-i' means restart specific server instance.

    Alias for 'sreload'
*psc*::
    Print available services.
*down* [-y]::
    Force appserver shutdown & resources cleanup. RUN ONLY IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING!
    Basically this kills all ATMI servers and Enduro/X daemon. This does NOT remove client
    processes.

    '-i'  is server id, '-s' is service name to be re-advertised.
*restart* [-y] [-s <server>] [-i <srvid>]::
    Restart app or service (invokes start & stop with same args!). '-y'

    attributes.
*psvc*::
    Shared mem, print services
*psrv*::

    Print global transactions in progress.
*printtrans*::
    Alias for 'pt'.
*abort* -t <transaction_manager_reference> -x <XID> [-g <resource_manager_id>] [-y]::
    Abort transaction. '-g' does abort single resource manager's transaction.
    '-y' is for auto confirmation.
*aborttrans*::

*commit* -t <transaction_manager_reference> -x <XID> [-y]::
    Commit transaction. '-y' is for auto confirmation.
*committrans*::
    Alias for 'commit'.
*recoverlocal* [-s <TM SERVICE>]::
    List local/for each TMSRV heuristic in-doubt transactions. This makes query
    to RM with xa_recover. With '-s' flag specific TMSRV service can be specified.
    otherwise all visible TMSRV servers are queried.
*commitlocal* [-s <TM SERVICE> [-x <XID>]] [-y]::
    Commit in-doubt transaction. If '-x' xid reported by recoverlocal is not
    specified, then all transactions are tried to be committed. If '-s' is set
    then specific TMSRV instance service is queried. If '-x' is set, '-s' must
    be set too, because specific XID must be part of some specific instance.
    The status of particular operation is reported back to stdout. Note that
    only prepared transactions can be processed by this command. Heuristically
    committed/aborted transaction may be only forgot. If so, context errors
    may be given.
*abortlocal* [-s <TM SERVICE> [-x <XID>]] [-y]::
    Abort in-doubt transaction. If '-x' xid reported by recoverlocal is not
    specified, then all transactions are tried to be aborted. If '-s' is set
    then specific TMSRV instance service is queried. If '-x' is set, '-s' must
    be set too, because specific XID must be part of some specific instance.
    The status of particular operation is reported back to stdout. Note that
    only prepared transactions can be processed by this command. Heuristically
    committed/aborted transaction may be only forgot. If so, context errors
    may be given.
*forgetlocal* [-s <TM SERVICE> [-x <XID>]] [-y]::
    Abort in-doubt transaction. If '-x' xid reported by recoverlocal is not
    specified, then all transactions are tried to be forgotten. If '-s' is set
    then specific TMSRV instance service is queried. If '-x' is set, '-s' must
    be set too, because specific XID must be part of some specific instance.
    The status of particular operation is reported back to stdout.
*pe*::
    Print Environment variables of 'ndrxd' process.
*printenv*::
    Alias for 'pe'.
*set* ENV_NAME=ENV VALUE::
    Set environment value. The value of env variable is parsed as command line arguments.
    Prior sending to 'ndrxd' they are concatenated with spaces in between.
*unset* ENV_NAME::
    Unset environment variable
*pc*::
    Print client processes. This sends command to Client Process Monitor server ('cpmsrv').
*bc* -t <process_tag> [-s <sub_section>] [-w <wait_time>]::
    Boot client process. This sends command to Client Process Monitor server ('cpmsrv').
    Processes are registered in 'ndrxconfig.xml' '<clients>' section. If sub section
    is not specified, then default value is minus sign ('-'). The 'process_tag'
    and 'sub_section' can contain wildcards percent ('%') sign. Then boot process will
    be executed in batch mode and progress will be returned to the xadmin's output.
    When running in batch mode 'wait_time' is time in milliseconds to sleep after
    each matched process is marked for start. Note that 'wait_time' shall be less
    than global timeout specified in 'NDRX_TOUT' env variable (or cconfig '[@global]'
    section).
*sc* -t <process_tag> [-s <sub_section>] [-w <wait time in milliseconds>]::
    Stop client process. This sends command to Client Process Monitor server ('cpmsrv').
    The process is stopped by 'process_tag' and optional 'sub_section'. If sub section
    is not specified, then default value is minus sign ('-'). The 'process_tag'
    and 'sub_section' can contain wild-card percent sign ('%'), then stopping is executed
    in batch mode (stop all matched running processes). If 'wait_time' is specified
    then in batch mode it is sleep in milliseconds after each stopped process.
    Note that 'wait_time' shall be less
    than global timeout specified in 'NDRX_TOUT' env variable (or cconfig '[@global]'
    section). Also time needed for stopping shall be counted in. If the timeout
    occurs, cpmsrv will complete the operation anyway.
*rc* -t <process_tag> [-s <sub_section>] [-w <wait time in milliseconds>]::
    Reload client process. This sends command to Client Process Monitor server ('cpmsrv').
    The process is reloaded (stopped/marked for start) by 'process_tag' and 
    optional 'sub_section'. If sub section is not specified, 
    then default value is minus sign ('-'). The 'process_tag' and 'sub_section' 
    can contain wild-card percent sign ('%'), then reloading is executed
    in batch mode (stop/start running processes one by one). 
    If 'wait_time' is specified then in batch mode it is sleep in 
    milliseconds after each stopped process. Note that 'wait_time' shall be less
    than global timeout specified in 'NDRX_TOUT' env variable (or cconfig '[@global]'
    section). Also time needed for stopping shall be counted in. If the timeout
    occurs, cpmsrv will complete the operation anyway. The 'wait_time' can be
    used in cases when reloading the binaries with out service interruption,
    in that case 'wait_time' should contain the *cpmsrv's* interval check 
    time ('-i' flag) because for start operation binary is only marked for 
    boot and not the booted. Basically this executes sc/bc for each of the 
    matched processes.
*mqlc*::
    List queue configuration. This broadcasts the requests of config listing to all 
    'tmqueue' servers. If flags column contains 'D' flag, then it means that queue
    was dynamically defined and QDEF string contains values from default queue.
*mqlq*::
    List actual queues allocated on system. Similarly as for 'mqlc' this requests
    the information from all 'tmqueue' servers. '#LOCK' column contains the number
    of active non committed messages in Q. '#SUCC' and '#FAIL' column contains number
    of processed messages for automatic queues (messages are sent to destination services
    automatically by 'tmqueue' server.
*mqrc*::
    This command requests all queue servers to reload the configuration file.
*mqlm* -s <QSpace> -q <QName>::
    List messages in queue. '-s' is queue space name (set by 'tmqueue' '-m' paramemter).
    The output lists the message ID in modified base64 version ('/' changed to '_').
*mqdm* -n <Cluster node id> -i <Server ID> -m <Message ID>::
    Dump/peek message to stdout. The values from '-n' (node id), '-i' (srvid), '-m'(message id)
    can be taken from 'mqlm' command. This command prints to stdout, the 'TQCTL' structure in form
    of UBF buffer and the message it self. If message is UBF, then UBF dump is made, otherwise
    hexdump of message is printed.
*mqch* -n <Cluster node id> -i <Server ID> -q <Q def (conf format)>::
    Change/add queue defnition to particular 'tmqueue' server. The format of the queue definition
    is the same as used 'q.conf(5)' (see the man page). You may miss out some of the bits 
    (except the queue name). Those other bits will be take from default q.
*mqrm* -n <Cluster node id> -i <Server ID> -m <Message ID>::
    Remove message from queue. You have to identify exact queue space server here by
    Enduro/X cluster id and server id.
*mqmv* -n <Source cluster node id> -i <Source server ID> -m <Source Message ID> -s <Dest qspace> -q <Dest qname>::
    Move the message from specific qspace server to destination qspace and qname. The bits 
    from 'TPQCTL' which are returned by 'tpdequeue()' call are preserved in new 'tpenqueue()' call.
    Note that for this call 'xadmin' must be in invalid XA environment, so that
    distributed transaction can be performed.
*killall* <name1> [<name2> ... <nameN>]::
    Kill all processes given by 'ps -ef'. The command does match the name in 
    the line. If substring is found, then process is killed.
*qrm*	<qname1> [<qname2> ... <qnameN>]::
    Remove specific Posix queue.
*qrmall* <substr1> [<substr2> ... <substrN>]::
    Remove queue matching the substring.
*provision* [-d] [-v<param1>=<value1>] ... [-v<paramN>=<valueN>]::
    Prepare initial Enduro/X instance environment, create folder structure,
    generate configuration files with ability to register all available services.
*gen* [-d] [-v<param1>=<value1>] ... [-v<paramN>=<valueN>]::
    Generate application sources. See the xadmin's help for more details.
    Currently it is possible to generate C and Go sources and the UBF buffer
    headers for both languages. By running the command, wizards will be offered
    asking for different details. Which later can be reconfigured by
    *-d* - allowing to default the wizard, while *-v* allows to set
    wizard values from command line.
*pubfdb*::
    Print UBF custom fields database contents to the terminal.
*cs* <cache_db_name>|-d <cache_db_name>::
    Print cache contents (headers) to the terminal. The database name is
    specified in 'cache_db_name' parameter.
*cacheshow*::
    Alias for 'cs'.
*cd* -d <dbname> -k <key> [-i interpret_result]::
    Dump specified message to the terminal. With specified '-i' flag, the attempt
    for data interpretation will be made. For UBF buffers the output will be
    formatted with command *Bprint()*.
*cachedump*::
    Alias for 'cd'.
*ci* -d <dbname> [-k <key>][-r use_regexp]::
    Invalidate cache. In case if only '-d' is specified, whole database will
    be dropped. Exact record may be dropped with '-k' flag. In case if '-r' is
    used, then key will be matched as regular expression over the data keys. In
    case if drop database is used, linked keygroup records are not processed. For
    other scenarios, linked records are processed according to the configuration.
*cachedump*::
    Alias for 'cd'.
*svmaps* [-p] [-s] [-a] [-i] [-w] ::
    Command is available only for System V messaging sub-system. Command prints
    the Queue ID (same ids from *ipcs* command) mappings to Posix queues used
    by Enduro/X. *-p* parameter (which is enabled by default) prints the mapping
    table from Posix Queue to System V. *-s* parameter uses reverse table by
    printing System V mappings to Posix. *-a* enables to print all the entries
    in the shared memory (there could be lots of lines printed. Totally set by
    *NDRX_MSGQUEUESMAX* environment variable). *-i* (used by default) prints 
    only the queues which currently are in use. *-w* prints mappings which
    were in use, but currently are not in use. The *-i*, *-w* arguments can
    be combined.
*shms*::
    Shows currently open shared memory segments.
*pmode*::
    Prints technical information about Enduro/X build mode 
    (basically ndrx_config.h).
*ps* [-a filter] [-b filter] [-c filter] [-d filter] [-r regexpfilter] [-p] [x pid]::
    Print running processes in system with command line arguments. This is similar
    to *ps -ef* in Linux or equivalents on other Operating Systems. Enduro/X
    *ps* command does not print the *xadmin* process, it is filtered out by
    default. The flags *-a*, *-b*, *-c* and *-d* are just a words that must
    be substring for the the ps output (i.e. basic grep). The *-r* argument is
    regular regular expression that must be matched. If none of these arguments
    are passed, then no filtering is done and max output is done (except the
    xadmin by it self). To enable printing PID only, use *-p* argument. To exclude
    particular PID from printing, use *-x* argument. The memory stats in kilobytes
    can be printed with turning on argument *-m* which must be used together with
    *-p*, then output is printed in format: "<pid>:<RSS>:<VSZ>", where RSS and
    VSS memory is printed in Kilobytes.
*appconfig* SETTING [NEWVALUE]::
    Change *ndrxconfig.xml(5)* "appconfig" section arguments dynamically for the
    process running. Settings available for changing are *sanity*, *checkpm*, 
    *brrefresh*, *restart_min*, *restart_step*, *restart_max*, 
    *restart_to_check*, *gather_pq_stats* and *rqaddrttl*. For their descriptions
    and possible values see *ndrxconfig.xml(5)* manpage. The syntax for command
    is that if *NEWVALUE* is not provided, then current value is printed. If
    *NEWVALUE* is provided, then value is changed and new value is printed to
    stdout. *ndrxd* must be running (or will be started in idle state). Note
    that configuration must be loaded in order to have non-error output from
    command.
*dping* [-c <loops>]::
    Perform ndrxd pings By default 4 loops are done, but this can be overridden
    by -c argument.
*dsleep* SLEEP_SEC::
    Put ndrxd in sleep mode, this is useful for debugging. Number of seconds to
    sleep are denoted in *SLEEP_SEC* argument.

CONFIGURATION
-------------
The following parameters from section *[@xadmin]* or *[@xadmin/<$NDRX_CCTAG>]*
are used (if config file is present):

*gen scripts*='PATH_TO_GENERATOR_SCRIPTS'::
This parameter configures the path where 'xadmin' should look for .pscript
files. The file names must be in following format: gen_<lang>_<type>.pscript.
Basically <lang> and <type> will be offered as targets under $xadmin gen
command. The $xadmin help will print these scripts. For script reference
look in Enduro/X source code, *xadmin/scripts* folder. It is assumed that 
these scripts will inherit 'WizardBase' class compiled into Enduro/X. This
class is driving the wizard. Also note that each parameter which is asked to
user enter into wizard, can be overridden from command line with
*-v<param1>=<value1>*. The generator can be defaulted by '-d' argument.

SAMPLE CONFIGURATION
--------------------

For system wide settings the following file is created: */etc/xadmin.config*:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[@xadmin]
gen scripts=/development/templates
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EXIT STATUS
-----------
*0*::
Success

*1*::
Failure
