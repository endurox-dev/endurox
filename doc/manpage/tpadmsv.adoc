NAME
----
tpadmsv - Enduro/X administrative server.


SYNOPSIS
--------
*tpadmsv* ['OPTIONS']


DESCRIPTION
-----------
This is XATMI server which provides *tm_mib(5)* interface backend. On request,
server process collects various system information, prepares the cursor (stored
in memory) and provides the response back to caller. Currently only *GET* and
*GETNEXT* operations are supported. The server process is optional for Enduro/X
and is used only to provide a solid framework for gathering system information.
*tpadmsv* collects information from following system parts:

- *ndrxd(5)* requests the information about processes (such as xadmin ppm), services
(such as xadmin psc).

- *open queues* - reads the list of IPC queues to extract the service information.

- *shared memory* - to extract the information about services, client processes
(such as *cpmsrv(5)*)

Every instance of *tmadmsv* will advertise following list of services:

1. .TMIB - command load balanced service for informational services

2. .TMIB-<NODE ID>-<SERVER ID> - particular instance for fetching the next window
of cursor data.

Each cursor returned from the *tmadmsv* encodes the the exact instance service
number i.e. service 2. Thus when fetching the next portion of data, normally
*.TMIB* service is called. If instance receive the cursor from other instance,
the message is forwarded to exact service name.


OPTIONS
-------
[*-n* 'MAX_CURSORS']::
This is max number of cursors allowed for process to create. If number of open
cursors is greater than this number, the *TAELIMIT* error is returned. The default
value is *100*.

[*-b* 'REPLY_BUFFER_SIZE']::
This is buffer size in bytes in which reply data window is loaded. When data is 
being loaded into reply buffer, cursor fetching algorithm ensures that before
loading object into buffer, the buffer free size is object size multiplied 
by 2 plus 1152 bytes. Default value is *4096* bytes.

[*-v* 'CURSOR_VALIDITY']::
Number of seconds to keep un-fetched cursors in memory. After this time the
cursor is zapped. Un-fetched cursors usually appears due to user program error
where fetch is not done till the end. The default value is *30* seconds.

[*-s* 'SCAN_TIME']::
Un-fetched cursor sanity scan time. Interval into which tests are made for
the cursors. The default value is *15* seconds.

EXIT STATUS
-----------
*0*::
Success

*1*::
Failure
