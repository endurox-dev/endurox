NAME
----
tpevsrv - Enduro/X Local Event Broker server.


SYNOPSIS
--------
*tpevsrv*


DESCRIPTION
-----------
This is special ATMI server which manages local event brokerage.
In bridged mode it also ensure that events are delivers to other nodes too i.e.
to other cluster nodes local event brokers, which dispatches events locally
to subscribed servers.
Following special services are advertised by 'tpevsrv':

. @TPEVSUBS - Service for doing local subscription to event receive by server.

. @TPEVUNSUBS - Service for unsubscribing from event (by server).

. @TPEVPOST - Do global posting. This is called actually by 'tppost()'.
			It dispatches events to local servers and does bridge calls.

. @TPEVDOPOST - This is local only posting. Used by bridges when they receive remote
			event postings.

Subscriptions to events are supported by per ATMI server instance.
Only one instance of server should be present in local Enduro/X instance.

Event server supports dispatch-threads multi-threading model. By default it
uses single thread, but *ndrxconfig.xml(5)* servers settings such as
'mindispatchtreads' and 'maxdispatchtreads' may be used to add some performance
boost for multi-threading.

The typical configuration looks like this (with 5 dispatching threads):

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

            <server name="tpevsrv">
                <srvid>10</srvid>
                <mindispatchthreads>5</mindispatchthreads>
                <maxdispatchthreads>5</maxdispatchthreads>
                <sysopt>-e ${NDRX_HOME}/log/tpevsrv.log -r</sysopt>
            </server>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note that any write operations such as sub-scribe or un-subscribe are executed
with exclusive write lock. Postings are executed with shared read lock.
