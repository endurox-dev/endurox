NAME
----
buildclient - Build XATMI server executable


SYNOPSIS
--------
*clientclient* ['OPTIONS']


DESCRIPTION
-----------
Build client is a binary which compiles and links the ATMI client binary executable.
Linkage does occur with Enduro/X UBF, ATMI and ATMI client libraries. The build
Entry point of main() for binary is expected to be present in user sources. 
Either in object files or *.c* passed to compile command. During the compilation,
resource manager XA switch name export symbol is generated and built-in in the
binary. If resource manager/XA switch is not passed to the build command, NULL
switch (*tmnull_switch*) is used. When configuration applications which uses
two phase commit where build-in switch usage is required, then XA group/RM must
be configured with *libndrxxatmsx(8)* driver, which resolves the built in symbol.

The generated source code which is linked with the binary looks like this:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

/* Buildclient auto-generated code */
/*---------------------------Includes-----------------------------------*/
#include <atmi.h>
#include <xa.h>
#if defined(_WIN32) || defined(__WIN32__) || defined(__CYGWIN__)
#define NDRX_API_EXPORT __declspec(dllexport)
#else
#define NDRX_API_EXPORT
#endif
extern struct xa_switch_t ndrxstatsw;
extern struct xa_switch_t * ndrx_xa_builtin_get(void);
expublic NDRX_API_EXPORT struct xa_switch_t *ndrx_G_p_xaswitch = &ndrxstatsw;
struct xa_switch_t * ndrx_switch_pull(void)
{
    return ndrx_xa_builtin_get();
}

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The command line template, how C compiler is invoked, is following:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<CC> [$CFLAGS] -o <binary_name> <generated_source>.c [-I<$NDRX_HOME>/include 
-L<NDRX_HOME>/{lib|lib64}] [<first_files>] [<RM_libs>] -latmicltbld -latmi -lubf -lnstd [<last_files>]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ENVIRONMENT
-----------
[*CC*]::
Optional environment variable indicating which C compiler to use. If parameter is
not set, the *cc* command is used.

[*CFLAGS*]::
Optional C flags to be passed to C compiler during the *cc* execution.

[*NDRX_HOME*]::
Optional environment variable indicating the Enduro/X installation home. If variable
is set then, "-I$NDRX_HOME/include" and "-L$NDRX_HOME/lib" (or lib64) is added 
to the *cc* command line.

OPTIONS
-------

[*-C*]::
COBOL mode. Reserved for future use.

[*-o* filename]::
Output file name for compiler. If not specified, then default is *SERVER*.

[*-f* firstfiles]::
Arguments to be passed to compiler command line. Typically here source file names, object
file names or library settings are passed. These names are included in compilation command
before Enduro/X libraries (from left to right).

[*-a*]::
Alias to '-f'.

[*-l* lastfiles]::
Arguments to be passed to compiler command line. Typically here source file names, object
file names or library settings are passed. These names are included in compilation command
after Enduro/X libraries (from left to right).

[*-r* rm_name]::
This is resource manager name. The resource manager according the specified name
shall be configured in *$NDRX_RMFILE* (first periority) or *$NDRX_HOME/udataobj/RM* file.
The file format is following 'rm_name:xa_switch_name:<compiler libraries>'. If 
specified, then 'xa_switch_name' is included in the process. Thus later *libndrxxatmsx(8)*
XA driver can be used (set in *NDRX_XA_DRIVERLIB* env var, see *ex_env(5)*), 
so that driver resolves built in symbols. Compiler libraries from resource manager 
are passed in command line after the first files. If switch name is not specified,
then default null switch 'tmnull_switch' is reference (present in libatmi.so).
Full format example can be seen in *buildserver(8)* manpage.

[*-k*]::
Keep the the generate source code with the main function. If not set, the file
is deleted when *buildserver* finishes.

[*-t*]::
Server is multi-threaded. Indicates that server can be started/configured in
multi-threaded mode. This flag is reserved for future use. Currently this
indication is built in the binary, but not used in any other way. Will be used
once Enduro/X will support multi-threaded service dispatching. Do not confuse
this flag with current Enduro/X threading model, as user threads are fully
supported.

[*-v*]::
Verbose mode. This will print the build command to stderr.

[*-h*]::
Print the help.


EXAMPLE
-------
See *atmitest/test071_buildtools/run.sh* for samples. Some of them:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ export CC=cc
$ buildclient -o atmiclt71_txn -a atmiclt71_txn.c -v -r TestSw -k \
    -f "-I../../include -L../../libatmi -L../../libubf -L../../libnstd -L ../../libatmiclt"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

That would result in following compilation unit:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

$ cc  -o atmiclt71_txn ndrx_bc_ANd6SM.c atmiclt71_txn.c -I../../include \
    -L../../libatmi -L../../libubf -L../../libnstd -L ../../libatmiclt \
    -L ../test021_xafull -l xadrv -latmicltbld -latmi -lubf -lnstd -lrt -ldl -lm -lc -lpthread

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


EXIT STATUS
-----------
*0*::
Success

*1*::
Failure
