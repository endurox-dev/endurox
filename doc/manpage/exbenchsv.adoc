NAME
----
exbenchsv - Enduro/X benchmark tool responder service


SYNOPSIS
--------
exbenchsv ['OPTIONS']


DESCRIPTION
-----------

This is dummy echo responder service used as back-end for *exbenchcl(8)* tool
responder. The service just returns succeed response with the same buffer for
very service call. Default service name advertised is *EXBENCH*. The service
works with any XATMI buffer type.

OPTIONS
-------
[*-N* 'CALL_SERVICE_NAME']::
Number of service names to advertise. If parameter is not set, then common
service name is advertised, either default or a value provided by *-s* flag.
If parameter is set, and is > 0, the service name is appended with NNN formatted
number which is calculated as Server ID modulus 1000 modulus 'CALL_SERVICE_NAME'
(i.e.: (tpgetsrvid() % 1000) % svcnum). Thus it is possible to boot several
service names, with having several servers advertising single service name.

[*-s* 'SERVICE_NAME']::
Service name to advertise. Default value is *EXBENCH*.

[*-T*]::
Enable transaction mode, performs *tpopen(3)* at init, and *tpclose(3)*
and server done.

[*-U* 'SLEEP_MICROSEC']::
Number of microseconds to sleep in the service functions. Default is *0*.

[*-e* 'EVENT_NAME']::
Event name to which to subscribe.


EXIT STATUS
-----------
*0*::
Success

*1*::
