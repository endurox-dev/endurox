NAME
----
edb_load - LMDB/EXDB environment import tool


SYNOPSIS
--------
*edb_load* [*-a*] [*-V*] [*-f* 'file'] [*-n*] [*-s* 'subdb'] [*-N*] [*-T*]  'envpath'


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The  *edb_load*  utility  reads  from  the standard input and loads it into the 
EXDB environment envpath.

The input to *edb_load* must be in the output format specified by the *edb_dump(8)*
utility  or  as specified by the *-T* option below.


OPTIONS
-------

[*-a*]::     
Append  all  records  in  the order they appear in the input. The input is 
assumed to already be in correctly sorted order and no sorting or checking for 
redundant values will be performed.  This option must be used to
reload data that was produced by running edb_dump on a 
database that uses custom compare functions.

[*-V*]::
Write the library version number to the standard output, and exit.

[*-f*]:: 'file'
Read from the specified file instead of from the standard input.

[*-n*]::
Load an EXDB database which does not use subdirectories.

[*-s*]:: 'subdb'
Load  a  specific  subdatabase.  If no database is specified, 
data is loaded into the main database.

[*-N*]::
Don't overwrite existing records when loading into an already existing database; 
just skip them.

[*-T*]::
Load  data from simple text files. The input must be paired lines of text, 
where the first line of the pair is the key item, and the second line of the 
pair  is  its  corresponding data item.

A  simple  escape  mechanism,  where  newline and backslash (\) characters are 
special, is applied to the text input. Newline characters are interpreted as 
record separators.  Back‚Äêslash  characters  in  the  text  will be 
interpreted in one of two ways: If the backslash character precedes another 
backslash character, the pair will be interpreted as a  literal backslash.  
If  the  backslash  character precedes any other character, the two characters 
following the backslash will be interpreted as a hexadecimal  specification  
of  a  single character; for example, \0a is a newline character in the ASCII 
character set.

For  this  reason,  any  backslash  or newline characters that naturally 
occur in the text input must be escaped to avoid misinterpretation by *edb_load*.

            
EXIT STATUS
-----------
Exit status is zero if no errors occur.  Errors result in a non-zero exit 
status and a diagnostic message being written to standard error.
