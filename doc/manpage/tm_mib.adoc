NAME
----
tm_mib - Transaction Manager Management Information Base


SYNOPSIS
--------

Management classes:

- *T_CLIENT* - Client process

- *T_DOMAIN* - Domain

- *T_MACHINE* - Machines in domain

- *T_QUEUE* - IPC Queues

- *T_SERVER* - XATMI server processes

- *T_SERVICE* - XATMI service definitions

- *T_SVCGRP* - XATMI service instances


DESCRIPTION
-----------
This is management information interface for Enduro/X. Currently only information
reading is available, setting or changing system characteristics via this interface
is not possible. Basically TM MIB interface in GET mode is designed, so that
user application can call in standard way ".TMIB" service with requesting
the information for particular object. These object types are encoded as classes.
Thus user requests information about some class, and TMIB service provided
by *tpadmsv(8)* will respond with objects found in system for particular class.

The information fetching is performed with standard *tpcall(3)* service invocations.
Request and response is encoded in UBF buffer format. At request certain fields
are filled (indicating the class and operation), at response the error fields
are filled, object information, number of objects found and number of objects
fetched. For each request cursor is open at particular *tpadmsv*, if objects
fetched are less than found, then cursor_id with GETNEXT operation code shall be
sent to .TMIB, to receive the next portion of data. When all data is fetched, the
cursor is deleted in particular process. Cursor is valid for configured period of
time, which is configured for *tpadmsv*.
