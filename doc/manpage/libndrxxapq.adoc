NAME

libndrxxapq - Enduro/X PostgreSQL PQ XA Driver


SYNOPSIS
--------


DESCRIPTION
-----------

This is XA driver specifically written Enduro/X needs. It provides an XA switch
emulation on top of PostgreSQL prepared transactions. PostgreSQL by default
does not support XA switch. Also when transaction start, there is no possibility
to identify the work unit performed. The identification of work done by some
process on particular connection can be done by preparing the transaction. Thus
there is no such thing as "active" transaction in terms of XA specification.
Also there is no possiblity for other processes to join the existing work and
see work done by other session. Thus for example if one server process in same
transaction performs some insert and other process tries insert on table which
has foreign key to first insert, it will fail, as FK will not be seen. Thus
Enduro/X needs to work on branch-transactions mode with out join feature. The
mode of PostgreSQL driver is the same as enabled by *NDRX_XA_FLAG* with value
*NOJOIN*. 

The emulation of XA protocol is done by following steps and assumptions:

1. When process joins to global transaction, new branch-transaction-id is
acquired. The TMSRV logs the branch with status 'u'-unknown.

2. When process completes the work unit (server does tpreturn(3) or tpforward(3))
or initiating process performs tpcommit(3), the xa_end() is called which in-turn
runs PostgreSQL "PREPARE TRANSACTION <XID_STR>". "XID_STR" is based on PosgreSQL
JDBC driver format. Thus JDBC version on PQ versions of tmsrv drivers can be mixed.
When transaction is prepared OK, the TMSRV is reported with 'p'-prepared status.
If prepare fails, this means that transaction is aborted by PosgreSQL, and in
this case 'a'-aborted status is reported to TMSRV.

3. When TMSRV tries to commit, and branch is in 'u'-unknown or 'a'-aborted status,
the global transaction is aborted and tpcommit caller receives *TPEABORT* error.
If transaction is in status 'p', the prepare phase of global transaction is
skipped/no operation and then commit is executed.

4. In case if work unit performs too long operation and tries to xa_end() after
when TMSRV is already timed-out/rolled back the global transaction, the xa_end()
tpcall sent to TMSRV fails with error *TPEMATCH*. In this case local process
rolls back the prepared transaction.

5. When tpabort is executed, the local xa_end() process performs
abort with out executing prepare.

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Enduro/X supports tpcall(3) caching, by writing results into LMDB. LMDB is
integral par to of the Enduro/X. To avoid conflict with users choice of LMDB
version, the embedded version is renamed to "EXDB", so that global C symbols
does not conflict. To configure Enduro/x tpcall caching, firstly database must
be configured. Enduro/X uses approach, that each database is stored into separate
file system directory. On Linux systems (or others which support RAM drivers),
the directory can be defined in RAM drive, and thus avoid the cache writing to
disk (as the LMDB uses memory mapped files). On Linux for this purpose /dev/shm
can be used.

Caching is performed at service level. Thus when software is doing *tpcall(3)*,
the client's call is intercepted, and tested against cache. If saved data is
found, then data is directly returned from LMDB and no service invocation is done.

Each cached item must have a key. The key is build from the call data. Key is zero
(0x00 byte) terminated string. Key format is given in cache configuration. Before
lookup to DB is made, rule expression is tested. This indicates either the call
must be cached or not. If rule is true, key is built and with key DB is tested,
if result is found, it is returned to caller. If result is not found, then service
invocation is performed. When service responds, data is written to cache.

Service can have multiple caches, with different rules. Once request is processed
the first cache which matches the rule is used for lookup or data saving.

Each cache references database definition, single database can be use by multiple
caches or each cache can have it's own database. Keeping multiple databases
could make better performance for caches were often writes are done. As concurrent
writes are synchronized so that only one process writes to the same database.

If writing to the same database, user shall ensure that keys are unique between
different service cache definitions. This can be reached by adding different
prefixes in key format.

DEFINITIONS
-----------

*Simple cache* - this is cache were data is saved in one cache database. No
linked databases are used.

*Keygroup* is separate database where records can be grouped. For example 
by user id. The group record holds the *UBF* buffer with string key occurrences
which are linked in the group. Keygroup database name is encoded as 

*Keyitem* is linked record to the group.


DATABASE DEFINITION
-------------------

*DBNAME_SECTION*::
    In case of simple database. This is a name of the database. For example
    "cachedb1". Allowed symbols a-z, A-Z, 0-9. In case of keygroup or keyitems
    databases, format for section is "<dbname>/<logical_db_name>. For the caches
    the db names are encoded as "<logical_db_name>@<dbname>". Parameter is
    *mandatory*.
*DBNAME_DB*::
    This is database name. For simple caches, name must be the same as 
    *DBNAME_SECTION*. For keygroup or keyitems databases name format is
    "<logical_db_name>@<dbname>". Parameter is *mandatory*.
*DATABASE_DIRECTORY*::
    This is file system directory where cache database is located. The directory
    must exist when application domain is started. In case of keygroup 
    and keyitems databases, the directory must be the same.
    Parameter is *mandatory*.
*FLAGS*::
    This is comma separated list of keywords - flags. See next section for list
    of flags supported for cache db.
*LIMIT*::
    If number of cached items in database must be limited (for example 1000 recs
    max), then the number is defined by this parameter. If this parameter is set
    then one of the following flags must be present *fifo*, *lru* or *hits* - 
    delete strategy. So that *tpcached(8)* process would know how to sort and
    which records to remove. The limit is not guaranteed maximum. As records are
    removed by *tpcached* daemon, there could be times that limit is overreached,
    because *tpcached* works with periods. And during the sleep time, more records
    could be added to db and only after sleep period *tpcached* will zap them.
*EXPIRY*::
    Time specification for record to live in cache. After time is passed, the
    *tpcached* process will zap the record. The configuration is specified as:
    N+s for seconds, (e.g. 20s), N+.D+m for minutes (e.g. 30.5m - 30 min, 30 sec)
    or N+.D+h for hours (e.g 3.5h, will store message for 3 hours and 30 minutes).
*MAX_READERS*::
    See LMDB documentation for this. Basically this is number of threads used
    by process. See LMDB's mdb_env_set_maxreaders() function description. The
    default value set by Enduro/X is *1000*.
*MAP_SIZE*::
    Maximum size of the database in bytes. The size must be multiple of OS page
    size. See LMDB's mdb_env_set_mapsize() function description. The default 
    value used by Enduro/X is *10485760*. Postifx multiplier can be used for
    value in configuration: kK(x1000) mM (x1000'000) gG (x1000'000'000) e.g. 10M.
*MAX_NAMED_DBS*::
    Maximum number of "named" logical databases in given resource. Named DB is
    only uses with "@" syntax, and usually only for keygroups (to keep transactions
    atomic between two DBs). The default value is *2*.
*DB_PERMISSIONS*::
    Octal permissions for map files on file system. The default value is *0664*.

DATABASE FLAGS
--------------
*bootreset*::
    Clean up the cache database when Enduro/X application domain is booting. The
    reset is performed by *tpcachebtsv* binary. Thus this binary must be configured
    in *ndrxconfig.xml(5)*. And it should be one of the first XATMI servers booted.
    The *tpcachetbsv* simple removes database files at boot.
*bcastput*::
    Should process perform broadcast (send event) of putting data in cache. If
    this is set and data is put into cache. This invokes calling *tpevsrv* with
    current tpcall response data buffer. Event is @CPNNN//<SVCNM>. Where NNN is
    cluster node id.
*bcastdel*::
    When cache data is deleted either by invalidate cache or by *tpcached*
    operations, if flag is set, the event is broadcasted to *tpevsrv*. The event
    in case of invalidated is @CDNNN/F/<SVCNM> (which contains the data buffer 
    by which data is deleted. It is buffer which performs invalidate, not 
    the actually stored data. Data is processed by cache's *delete* parameter
    which might limit the data sent for deletion over the event server - in order
    to save some traffic). The NNN is cluster node id which initiates the
    invalidate. The F is flags, in case if is 'G', then whole group is deleted if
    record is part of the keygroup, otherwise 'F' flag (full) is sent.
*timesync*::
    Full path to file containing environment variable overrides.
    see 'ex_envover(5)' for more details. This can be overridden
    by per server basis by ENV_OVERRIDE_SRV. 
    Both are optional settings.
*scandup*::
    Full path to file containing environment variable overrides.
    see 'ex_envover(5)' for more details. This can be overridden
    by per server basis by ENV_OVERRIDE_SRV. 
    Both are optional settings.
*clrnosvc*::
    Clear cache when service for which data is cached, is not advertised anymore
    by any XATMI server. The cleanup is performed by *tpcached*.
*keyitems*::
    This is key-items database. Required flag for keygroup items database pair.
*keygroup*::
    This database is for storing key-groups. Note that when using key-group, both
    keyitems and keygroup must be in the same physical resource. And syntax
    for boths databases must be "<logical_db_name>@<dbname>".
*nosync*::
    Do not perform fsync (flush to disk) when committing transaction. This is
    suitable for caches which are reset at boot. Used for performance increase.
    In case of persisted databases (used after reboot), at case of crash, this
    data might be corrupt. See *MDB_NOSYNC* mode for mdb_env_open().
*nometasync*::
    Flush metadata only when doing commit. The risks are the same as with *nosync*.
    Recommended for non persisted caches. See *MDB_NOMETASYNC* for mdb_env_open()
    function.

CACHE DEFINITION
----------------
*CACHE_DBNAME*::
    Reference to database name. This must match with chosen storage db *DBNAME_DB*.
*CACHE_FLAGS*::
    Flags of the cache (comma separate of flags for cache). See section bellow for
    flags available.
*TYPE*::
    This is buffer type name for which cache is designed. Currently supported type
    is *UBF*.
*SUBTYPE*::
    This is buffer sub type. For example for *VIEW* buffers this is view name.
    Currently this parameter is reserved for future use.
*RULE*::
    This is buffer type specific expression for defining the rule in which case
    the call shall be cached/cache-looked-up or not. If rule is not specified, then
    by default call is accepted for cache. In case if *TYPE* is UBF, then standard
    boolean expression applies here.
*KEYFMT*::
    This is buffer type specific format. For *UBF* fields this is format string
    which might contain field free text with format of '$(UBF_FIELD)', where 
    given construction will be substituted with UBF field value of field 'UBF_FIELD'.
    For example having 'T_STRING_3_FLD' equal to *ABC* and 'T_STRING_2_FLD' occurrence 2
    equal to  XX' and format string 'SV1$(T_STRING_3_FLD)-$(T_STRING_2_FLD[1])', 
    then key will render as 'SV1ABC-XX'. Key is used to distinguish under which
    record to save the data and how to lookup data into database.
*SAVE*::
    This field specifies how data is saved into cache. It is type specific and
    and flags specific. For *UBF* buffer with flag *putfull* full UBF buffer is
    saved. If flag is not specified and 'SAVE' is set to * then full buffer
    is saved too. If flags is not specified, but it is comma separated list of
    *UBF* fields, then only those fields are saved to cache. If flags is set to
    *putrex*, then 'SAVE' field shall contain regular expression which is executed
    on buffer fields (names). The names which matches expression are added to
    cache.
*DELETE*::
    This field specifies field which shall be broadcast to other cluster node
    in case if invalidate their cache is performed. This makes a projection of
    incoming buffer in order to save the traffic. The projected buffer is then
    sent to event server for other cluster node processing. Rules for
    the field syntax is similar to the 'SAVE' parameter.
    For *UBF* buffer with flag *delfull* full UBF buffer is sent in event.
    If flag is not specified and 'SAVE' is set to  * then full buffer
    is sent too. If flags is not specified, but it is comma separated list of
    *UBF* fields, then only those fields are sent in event. If flags is set to
    *delrex*, then 'DELETE' field shall contain regular expression which is executed
    on buffer fields (names). The names which matches expression are added to
    to buffer which is sent to other cluster node.
*RSPRULE*::
    This is boolean expression with following two fields in buffer *EX_TPERRNO*
    which corresponds to *tperrno* of tpcall() and *EX_TPURCODE* corresponds to
    tpcall() user return code. If *RSPRULE* setting is not present, then cached
    are only successful calls (i.e. EX_TPERRNO==0).
*REFRESHRULE*::
    Optional type specific expression. When performing tpcall(), the saved data
    is returned from cache. In case if this expression is defined and executes
    true on tpcall buffer,the real service all will be performed, 
    even if data in cache are present. For *UBF* buffers this is boolean expression.
*INVAL_SVC*::
    This is service name if "their" service to be invalidated. When service call
    is performed, this "allows" to intercept the call and when response is received
    the other service cache, specified in 'INVAL_SVC' will be reset (removed
    cached data). The key used for data access is build by this invalidate cache
    and not by target 'INVAL_SVC' cache definition. If target cache uses
    *invalkeygrp* flag, then then whole group is invalidated. The group access is
    made by 'KEYGRPDB' and 'KEYGRPFMT'.
*INVAL_IDX*::
    This is cache index (zero based array index) of target invalidate service cache.
    This must be defined in case if 'INVAL_SVC' parameter is used, this parameter
    must be set too.
*KEYGRPDB*::
    Optional key group database name. The database must be consists be in format
    of <logical database>@<physical database name>. If using 'KEYGRPDB' DB, then
    the 'CACHE_DBNAME' must be set in the same format. So that logical names for
    cache database is different but physical is the same. Physical resources must
    be the same for LMDB, for need to ensure transactional consistency between
    group and items.
*KEYGRPFMT*::
    This format string to build a key for a group. It shall be lower level
    of object "resolution", to have something common between linked 'KEYFMT'.
    For example if paging (user iterates over her statement) needs to be cached
    and invalidated at any single transaction, then 'KEYGRPFMT' is the userid
    and 'KEYFMT' shall contain userid and page number. The syntax for 'KEYGRPFMT'
    is the same as for 'KEYFMT' is buffer type specific. Field is *conditional*,
    must be present when configuring key group.
*KEYGROUPMAX*::
    Key group can be used to protect against DoS attacks - by limiting number
    of "new" records that can appear in key group. The time component is
    processed by *tpcached* binary, which could remove key group after it is
    expired. They 'KEYGROUPMAX' is number records allowed in key group.
    Parameter is *optional*.
*KEYGROUPMREJ*::
    This is buffer definition which shall be filled in response (merged or
    replaced according to flags) in case if cache lookup is made, request is
    part of key group, record does not exists and number of records in key
    group already reached 'KEYGROUPMAX'. In this case service call is denied
    and response is filled with buffer definition found in this parameter. For
    *UBF* buffers, it is UBF buffer defined in JSON format (see tpjsontoubf(3)
    man page). Parameter is *conditional* and must be present in case if 'KEYGROUPMAX'
    is set.
*KEYGRPMAXTPERRNO*::
    In case of doing reject for 'KEYGROUPMAX' max reached, this is TP error code
    that tpcall(3) will return. Normally it would be *11* (service routine error).
    Parameter is *optional*, if not present the error value will be *0* - no
    error, thus data should indicate that reject was performed.
*KEYGRPMAXTPURCODE*::
    Value of user return code in case if doing key group max reject. See
    *tpurcode(3)*. Parameter is *optional* and if not set and reject will be
    performed, user return code value will be *0*.

CACHE FLAGS
-----------
*putfull*::
    Flag indicates that when saving data to cache full XATMI buffer shall be
    saved. In case if *putfull* or *putrex* is not present then 'SAVE' parameter
    is analyzed.
*putrex*::
    Indicates that 'SAVE' field is regular expression. *putfull* and *putrex*
    flags cannot be mixed.
*getreplace*::
    Flag indicates that if data is returned from, then buffer passed to
    *tpcall(3)* must be replaced with data from cache.
*getmerge*::
    Flag indicates that if data is returned from, then buffer passed to
    *tpcall(3)* must be merged with incoming data. If using *UBF* buffer type
    then for merge operation *Bupdate(3)* is used. Where destination buffer
    is buffer passed to *tpcall(3)* and source buffer is one save in cache.
*next*::
    Flag indicates that next cache (if having multiple for single service) should
    be processed, after this one. Flag is suitable for cases when current cache
    is invalidate their. Thus invalidate is performed and for example at next
    cache would be actually save results. Or multiple invalidates can be configured.
*delfull*::
    When using invalidate cache, then this flag indicates that full XATMI buffer
    sent to tpcall() shall be broadcasted (published in event) to other nodes.
    In case of UBF buffer if flag is not present, then * in 'DELETE' cache
    parameter indicates all fields must be Broadcast. If not * then it is
    comma separated list of fields.
*delrex*::
    This indicates that 'DELETE' parameter is regular expression. In case of
    UBF buffer, the expression is executed on each field in incoming buffer,
    if field name matches expression, then it is added to broadcast list.
*inval*::
    Flag indicates that this cache is invalidate. In this case cache parameters
    'INVAL_SVC' and 'INVAL_IDX' must be present.
*invalkeygrp*::
    If performing invalidated of record and record is part of key group, then
    delete whole key group (all linked records and group by it self). If flag
    is not present, then single record is delete (keyitem) and group is updated
    (linkage removed from group). This flag applies to all mechanisms how
    record can be removed, either by invalidate their, or zapped by *tpcached*
    or deleted by xadmin tooling.

PERFORMANCE
-----------
For performance reasons, if non persistent cache is required, it is recommended
to store data file in RAM driver, for example on GNU/Linux systems it is
*/dev/shm*. It is considered that in such scenario LMDB will use twice the
memory. As one is a copy in RAM drive and another is mapped pages in process
to the file. It is up to kernel realization to make some optimizations here.
