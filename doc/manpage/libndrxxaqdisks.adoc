DESCRIPTION
-----------
This is Enduro/X *tmqueue(8)* XA driver loader and actual disk based message
queue driver. The actual logic is implemented in *libndrxxaqdisk* library. All
following text describes the work logic of *libndrxxaqdisk*.

The Open string specifies the the data directory in *datadir* parameter,
where the transaction and message data is kept. *WARNING:* the data directory
cannot be shared between different queue spaces, as that can cause data corruption
between queue spaces. The queue space name is specified in *qspace* parameter.

The Open String *NDRX_XA_OPEN_STR* data is separated by either "," or space.
the data for the keys may be put in single or double quotes.

The XA switch provided *libndrxxaqdisk* is used by *tmqueue(8)* and *tmsrv(8)*
processes. XA operations are processed in following way:

- If process which processes command is not *tmqueue*, the command is sent to
queue space service.

- If XA command is processed by *tmqueue* process, then actual logic is performed.

When library is started, it prepare the following directories,
under the *NDRX_XA_OPEN_STR:*

- 'NDRX_XA_OPEN_STR'/*active* - used for active command block files. File names
contain global transaction id with sequence number suffix.

- 'NDRX_XA_OPEN_STR'/*prepared* - used for prepared command block files. File names
contain global transaction id with sequence number suffix.

- 'NDRX_XA_OPEN_STR'/*committed* - used for committed command block files. File
names are set to message id. Here only message files are stored, and no other
command blocks (.e.g. nor delete, nor update files).

*NDRX_XA_OPEN_STR* specified directory cannot be shared between different 
*tmqueue(8)* processes having different *NDRX_XA_RES_ID*.

Command block files have following types:

- New message, including message blob.

- Update message command file (used for automatic forward queue updates). Contains
updated header information to replace in message file.

- Delete message (after dequeue).

- Dummy message (used for marking prepared read only transactions, and are associated
at startup with any active transaction, to perform rollbacks with out message file
content read).

Each command block file refers to one message only, thus sequence numbers are
used for keeping them linked to one global. Thought this architecture partially 
breaks the Atomicity property of ACID, as committed or rollbacked messages
in queue appears one by one, instead of all by once.

To ensure that messages does not corrupt in case of power outage, disk synchronization 
*NDRX_XA_FLAGS* configuration may be set (the default is not set):

- Set flag *FSYNC* to ensure the enqueued message contents are flushed to disk.

- Set flag *FDATASYNC* instead of *FSYNC*, to ensure that message contents are
persisted to disk, but file modification time stamps are not updated (for
faster flushing reasons).

- Conditionally set *DSYNC* (for Linux and Solaris), to synchronize file system
contents to disk when new message file is created. For other operating systems,
please consult with vendor manuals, when directory must flushed (fsync()) in order
to persist the new file.

- The default approach by tmqueue disk queue driver is to use fflush() unix call
to submit changes to OS kernel, instead to disk.

NB: If using *FSYNC*, *FDATASYNC*, *DSYNC* expect performance impact of the
message processing.

Operations with disk are following for *tpenqueue(3)*:

- New file containing the new message command block (including message buffer content)
is create in *active* directory. If configured *FSYNC* or *FDATASYNC* flags, 
the file contents are synchronized to disk with fsync() or fdatasync(). File
name corresponds to global transaction id, with "-NNN" suffix, where NNN is command
block sequence number in the transactions.

- When prepare happens (tpcommit() issued), command file (new message) is 
moved to *prepared* directory, if *DSYNC* flag is set, fsync() call is 
used to synchronize directory to disk.

- When commit happens from 2PC, message file is moved to *committed* directory.
If *DSYNC* is set, directory is synchronized with fsync(). During the move of
the message files, the file is renamed to match the message id, instead of 
transaction id.

Operations with disk are following for *tpdequeue(3)*:

- New file containing delete message command block file is create in *active* directory. 
If configured *FSYNC* or *FDATASYNC* flags, the file contents are synchronized 
to disk with fsync() or fdatasync(). File name corresponds to global transaction id, 
with "-NNN" suffix, where NNN is command block sequence number in the transactions.

- When prepare happens (tpcommit()), command file (delete message) is 
moved to *prepared* directory, if *DSYNC* flag is set, fsync() call is 
used to synchronize directory to disk.

- When commit happens of 2PC, the dequeued message is removed from *committed*
directory. If *DSYNC* is set, *committed* directory is synchronized with disk. 
Afterwards command block of delete message is removed from *prepared* directory.

ASSUMPTIONS
-----------
To ensure transactionality of the message files, following assumptions are used:

- File system file rename operation is atomic.

- Disk sector writes are assumed to be atomic.
