DESCRIPTION
-----------
This is Enduro/X *tmqueue(8)* XA driver loader and actual disk based message
queue driver. When library is started, it prepare the following directories,
under the *NDRX_XA_OPEN_STR:*

- 'NDRX_XA_OPEN_STR'/*active* - used for active command block files. File names
contain global transaction id with sequence number suffix.

- 'NDRX_XA_OPEN_STR'/*prepared* - used for prepared command block files. File names
contain global transaction id with sequence number suffix.

- 'NDRX_XA_OPEN_STR'/*committed* - used for committed command block files. File
names are set to message id. Here only message files are stored, and no other
command blocks (.e.g. nor delete, nor update files).

Command block files have following types:

- New message, including message blob.

- Update message command file (used for automatic forward queue updates). Contains
updated header information to replace in message file.

- Delete message (after dequeue).

Each command block file refers to one message only, thus sequence numbers are
used for keeping them linked to one global. Thought this architecture partially 
breaks the Atomicity property of ACID, as committed or rollbacked messages
in queue appears one by one, instead of all by once.

*NDRX_XA_FLAGS* configuration:

- Set flag *FSYNC* to ensure the enqueued message contents are flushed to disk.

- Set flag *FDATASYNC* instead of *FSYNC*, to ensure that message contents are
persisted to disk, but file modification time stamps are not updated (for
faster flushing reasons).

- Conditionally set *DSYNC* (for Linux and Solaris), to synchronize file system
contents to disk when new message file is created. For other operating systems,
please consult with vendor manuals, when directory must flushed (fsync()) in order
to persist the new file.

- The default approach by tmqueue disk queue driver is to use fflush() unix call
to submit changes to OS kernel, instead to disk.

NB: If using *FSYNC*, *FDATASYNC*, *DSYNC* expect performance impact of the
message processing.

Operations with disk are following for *tpenqueue(3)*:

- New file containing the new message command block (including message buffer content)
is create in *active* directory. If configured *FSYNC* or *FDATASYNC* flags, 
the file contents are synchronized to disk with fsync() or fdatasync().

- When prepare happens (tpcommit() issued), command file (new message) is 
moved to *prepared* directory, if *DSYNC* flag is set, fsync() call is 
used to synchronize directory to disk.

- When commit happens from 2PC, message file is moved to *committed* directory.
If *DSYNC* is set, directory is synchronized with fsync().

Operations with disk are following for *tpdequeue(3)*:

- New file containing delete message command block file is create in *active* directory. 
If configured *FSYNC* or *FDATASYNC* flags, the file contents are synchronized 
to disk with fsync() or fdatasync().

- When prepare happens (tpcommit()), command file (delete message) is 
moved to *prepared* directory, if *DSYNC* flag is set, fsync() call is 
used to synchronize directory to disk.

- When commit happens of 2PC, the dequeued message is removed from *committed*
directory. If *DSYNC* is set, *committed* directory is synchronized with disk. 
Afterwards command block of delete message is removed from *prepared* directory.
