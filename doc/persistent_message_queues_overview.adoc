Persistent queues
-----------------
EnduroX system is built on kernel based real-time IPC queues. Which by definition are not persistent.
When server is restarted, memory data is lost, thus the data in message queues are lost. In some of
the application scenarios persistent messaging is required. Thus EnduroX offers standard ATMI calls
such as 'tpenqueue()' and 'tpdequeue()'. System also supports automatic queues, where messages
are automatically forwarded to configured services.

Messages are stored in file system. To ensure transactional operation, file move/rename is
employed which by it self (in the terms of one file system) is transactional.

The queues are grouped into queue spaces. Queue space grouping element of multiple queue servers.
Queue space basically is service name for backing 'tmqueue' server. Each queue server
can stores it's data in specified file system folders. The 'tmqueue' server works in tandem with
'tmsrv' to ensure the compatibility with global transaction processing.
