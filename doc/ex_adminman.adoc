== How to configure Enduro/X

To configure Enduro/X you have to finish several steps.

. Have a separate system user for each Enduro/X instance.

. Setup System Environment (mount mq file system, configure mq params)

. Setup environment configuration

. Setup basic environment (demo)

. Startup the application

== Setup System Environment

Enduro/X supports different back-end message transports. Following mechanisms
are available:

- EPOLL (for FreeBSD it is Kqueue) over the Posix queues. This is fastest and
most preferred transport mechanism when available. True on queue multiple
servers mechanism is supported for different services across different XATMI
server binaries (transport code "epoll" for GNU/Linux and "kqueue" for FreeBSD).

-  System V message queues, this is generally second best transport available
on Linux and Unix operating systems. One queue multiple servers mechanism is
available via Request Address option (rqaddr) for XATMI server. The limitation is that
each server running on same request address *MUST* provide all services provided
by other servers in same Request Address. This mechanism uses at-least one 
additional thread per XATMI participant for handling message send/receive time-outs.
In case if XATMI server, additional more thread is used for administrative message
handling and dispatching to main server thread. Thus compiler must support
the multi-threaded operations for user applications (transport code "SystemV").

- The third option if POLL over the Posix queues. This uses round-robin approach
for message delivery to load balanced servers. One additional thread is used
for server process to monitor queues (transport code "poll").

- The forth option is emulated message queue which uses shared memory and process
shared Posix locks to emulate the mssage queue (transport code "emq").

'X' - not supported.

Each of these IPC transports for particular operating system requires specific
approach for configuring the limits and other attributes for runtime.

Note that transport version is built into Enduro/X distribution. Thus to change
the IPC transport, different Enduro/X version must be installed (i.e. cannot
be changed by parameters). As the ABI for user apps stays the same, the user
application is not required to be rebuilt.

=== Release file format

The release file for Enduro/X encodes different information. For example
file names 

. endurox-5.4.1-1.ubuntu18_04_GNU_epoll.x86_64_64.deb 

. endurox-5.4.1-1.SUNOS5_10_GNU_SystemV.sparc_64

encodes following information:

|=========================================================

=== Linux setup

In this chapter will be described typical GNU/Linux system configuration required
for Enduro/X. Two sets of configurations are available for Linux OS. One is for
Posix queues with epoll and another configuration is System V configuration.

Kernel parameter configuration is needed for Enduro/X runtime. But as we plan here
to build the system and run unit-tests, then we need a configuration for runtime.

==== Increase OS limits

---------------------------------------------------------------------
$ sudo -s
# cat << EOF >> /etc/security/limits.conf

# Do not limit message Q Count.
# Some Linux 3.x series kernels have a bug, that limits 1024 
# queues for one system user.
# In 2.6.x and 4.x this is fixed, to have 
# unlimited count of queues (memory limit).
# ealrier and later Linuxes have fixed this issue.
*               soft    msgqueue        -1
*               hard    msgqueue        -1

# Increase the number of open files 
*               soft    nofile  1024
*               hard    nofile  65536

EOF
# exit
$
---------------------------------------------------------------------

==== Linux system setup for running in EPOLL/Posix queue mode

This step request mounting of Posix queues and change Posix queue limits

===== Mounting Posix queues

This step does not apply to following Operating Systems - for these continue with
next chapter:

. Ubuntu 16.04 and above

. Debian 8.x and above

When running in e-poll mode Enduro/X needs access to virtual file system which
provides Posix queue management. One way would be to mount it via "/etc/fstab",
but for older system compatibility, we provide instructions that would work for
all OSes. To do this automatically at system startup, Linuxes which supports 
'/etc/rc.local', must add following lines before "exit 0".

---------------------------------------------------------------------
#!/bin/bash

# Mount the /dev/mqueue
# Not for Debian 8.x: queue is already mounted, thus test:

if [ ! -d /dev/mqueue ]; then
	mkdir /dev/mqueue
	mount -t mqueue none /dev/mqueue
fi

exit 0
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Note for Centos/RHEL/Oracle Linux 7+ you need to give execute 
permissions for rc.local:

---------------------------------------------------------------------
# chmod +x /etc/rc.local
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Load the configuration by doing:

---------------------------------------------------------------------
# /etc/rc.local
---------------------------------------------------------------------

===== Setting Posix queue limits

Next step is to configure queue limits, this is done by changing Linux kernel
parameters, in persistent way, so that new settings are applied at the OS boot.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
# Max Messages in Queue
$ sudo sysctl -w fs.mqueue.msg_max=10000

# Max message size, to pass unit tests, use 1M+1K
$ sudo sysctl -w fs.mqueue.msgsize_max=1049600

# Max number of queues for user
$ sudo sysctl -w fs.mqueue.queues_max=10000

# Apply kernel parameters now
$ sudo sysctl --system
---------------------------------------------------------------------

==== Setting System V queue limits

To pass the Enduro/X unit tests, certain queue configuration is required. Use
following kernel settings:

---------------------------------------------------------------------
# max queues system wide, 40K should be fine
$ sudo sysctl -w kernel.msgmni=40000

# max size of message (bytes), ~1M should be fine
$ sudo sysctl -w kernel.msgmax=1049600

# default max size of queue (bytes), ~10M should be fine
$ sudo sysctl -w kernel.msgmnb=104960000

# Apply kernel parameters now
$ sudo sysctl --system
---------------------------------------------------------------------

=== FreeBSD setup

For FreeBSD only officially supported version if Posix queues, thus this operating
system requires some settings for these IPC resources to pass the unit testing and
also settings are generally fine for average application.

==== Configuring the system
Queue file system must be mounted when OS starts. Firstly we need a folder 
'/mnt/mqueue' where the queues are mount. And secondly we will add the automatic 
mount at system startup in '/etc/fstab'.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
# mkdir /mnt/mqueue
# cat << EOF >> /etc/fstab
null    /mnt/mqueue     mqueuefs	     rw	     0	     0
EOF
# mount /mnt/mqueue
---------------------------------------------------------------------

You also need to change the queue parameters: 

---------------------------------------------------------------------
# cat << EOF >> /etc/sysctl.conf

# kernel tunables for Enduro/X:
kern.mqueue.curmq=1
kern.mqueue.maxmq=30000
kern.mqueue.maxmsgsize=64000
kern.mqueue.maxmsg=1000

EOF

# sysctl -f /etc/sysctl.conf
---------------------------------------------------------------------

For LMDB testing more semaphores shall be allowed

---------------------------------------------------------------------
# cat << EOF >> /boot/loader.conf

# kernel tunables for Enduro/X:
kern.ipc.semmns=2048
kern.ipc.semmni=500

EOF

---------------------------------------------------------------------

After changing /boot/loader.conf, reboot of system is required.

Enduro/X testing framework uses '/bin/bash' in scripting, thus we must
get it working. Also perl is assumed to to be '/usr/bin/perl'. Thus:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
# ln -s /usr/local/bin/bash /bin/bash
# ln -s /usr/local/bin/perl /usr/bin/perl
---------------------------------------------------------------------

*reboot* to apply new settings (limits & mqueue mount)

=== AIX setup
On the other hand AIX do not require any fine tuning for System V queues, because
it is doing automatic adjustments to queue limitations.

=== Solaris setup

To pass the Enduro/X unit tests on Solaris, System V queue settings must be applied.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
# cat << EOF >> /etc/system
set msgsys:msginfo_msgmni = 10000
set msgsys:msginfo_msgmnb = 10496000

EOF
---------------------------------------------------------------------

So here 'msgmni' is maximum number of queues that can be created and 'msgmnb'
is single queue maximum size which here is 10MB.

After changing the settings, reboot the server.


=== MacOS setup

OSX does not use require any kernel parameter changes, as emulated message queue
is used here. Only it required that sufficient disk space is available to '/tmp'
directory, as the memory mapped queue files will be stored there.

== Setup environment configuration

Enduro/X depends lot of Environment variables. See manpage of 'ex_env' (<<EX_ENV>>)
to see all parameters that must be setup. There is also sample configuration
provided. Normally it is expected that separate shell script file is setup containing
all parameters. Then to load the environment, login with Enduro/X user in, and run
following command in your app dir, for example:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ cd /endurox/app/conf
$ . setapp
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

== Setting up Enduro/X demon environment

This section describes how to create a basic Enduro/X environment. Document will
also explain the resources used by Enduro/X from the system setup and
administrative perspective. Section will also explain the contents for each of
the generated file, so that runtime can be manually reconstructed, which is
usable for AIX operating system, as there "xadmin provision" command is not 
available.

=== Creating default runtime and starting it up

To create generic runtime with Enduro/X "stock" servers processes, use following
command:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ xadmin provision  -d
To control debug output, set debugconfig file path in $NDRX_DEBUG_CONF

To start your system, run following commands:
$ cd /tmp/demo/conf
$ source settest1
$ xadmin start -y


Provision succeed!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------





Vital part of Enduro/X is 'ndrxdconfig.xml' config. Full path to it is configured
in 'NDRX_CONFIG' environment variable.
To see how to setup see manpage of it <<NDRXCONFIG>>.

=== Start Enduro/X application

To start the Enduro/X application, login with Enduro/X instance user, and issue
following command 'xadmin start', for example:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ xadmin start -y
ndrxd PID (from PID file): 25037
exec tpevsrv -k 0myWI5nu -i 14 -e /tmp/TPEVSRV -r --  :
	process id=26793 ... Started.
exec tpbridge -k 0myWI5nu -i 101 -e /tmp/BRIDGE002 -r -- -n2 -r -i 0.0.0.0 -p 4433 -tP -z30 :
	process id=26794 ... Started.
exec tpbridge -k 0myWI5nu -i 102 -e /tmp/BRIDGE012 -r -- -n12 -r -i 10.10.10.2 -p 14433 -tA -z30 :
	process id=26795 ... Started.
Startup finished. 3 processes started.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To see all commands available by 'xadmin' (xa) see manpage of it <<XADMIN>>.

=== Recovery from crashed local ATMI monitor

Enduro/X is capable to continue with out restart in case if 'ndrxd' local ATMI
monitor is crashed or contains invalid data structures for some reason. In this
case administrator can do following:

- $ kill -9 <ndrxd PID>
- remove ndrxd queue, for example: $ rm /dev/mq/n00b,sys,bg,ndrxd
- restart 'ndrxd' in learning mode, by: $ nohup ndrxd -k $NDRX_RNDK -r 

=== Cluster configuration

To setup cluster see you have to setup bridge ATMI processes on each of the machines.
See <<TPBRIDGE>> documentation to have understanding of clustering. Sample setup of
cluster node which activetly connects to Node 2 and waits call from Node 12 could
look like:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<endurox>
	<appconfig>
		<sanity>10</sanity>
		<brrefresh>6</brrefresh>
		<restart_min>1</restart_min>
		<restart_step>1</restart_step>
		<restart_max>5</restart_max>
		<restart_to_check>20</restart_to_check>
	</appconfig>
	<defaults>
		<min>1</min>
		<max>2</max>
		<autokill>1</autokill>
		<respawn>1<respawn>
		<start_max>2</start_max>
		<pingtime>1</pingtime>
		<ping_max>4</ping_max>
		<end_max>3</end_max>
		<killtime>1</killtime>
	</defaults>
	<servers>
		<!-- Connect to cluster node 2, we will wait for call -->
		<server name="tpbridge">
			<max>1</max>
			<srvid>101</srvid>
			<sysopt>-e /tmp/BRIDGE002 -r</sysopt>
			<appopt>-n2 -r -i 0.0.0.0 -p 4433 -tP -z30</appopt>
		</server>
		<!-- Connect to cluster node 12, we try to connect activetly to it -->
		<server name="tpbridge">
			<max>1</max>
			<srvid>102</srvid>
			<sysopt>-e /tmp/BRIDGE012 -r</sysopt>
			<appopt>-n12 -r -i 195.122.24.13 -p 14433 -tA -z30</appopt>
		</server>
	</servers>
</endurox>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

=== Max message size and internal buffer sizes

Starting from Enduro/X version 5.1+, the max message size what can be transported
over the XATMI sub-system is limited to the operating system's queue settings.
For example on Linux kernel 3.13 the message size limit (/proc/sys/fs/mqueue/msgsize_max)
is around 10 MB. The message size is configured with 'NDRX_MSGMAX' environment
variable, see ex_env(5) man page.

Also what should be noted, as Enduro/X mostly uses stack allocation
instead of heap allocation (for safer and faster code), then there are requirements
against the stack size. The stack size (ulimit -s) must be at least size of message
multiplied with 30. So for example if message size is set to 1 MegaByte, then stack
size shall be set to 30 Mega bytes (ulimit -s 30720 KB). If the stack is not sufficient
the following error will be print when attempting to run any Enduro/X based software:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Logging to ./ULOG.20171112
Failed to open [./ULOG.20171112]
 9138:20171112:19144166:xadmin      :LIMITS ERROR ! Please set stack (ulimit -s) size to: 1966080 bytes or 1920 kb (calculated by: NDRX_MSGSIZEMAX(65536)*NDRX_STACK_MSG_FACTOR(30))

LIMITS ERROR ! Please set stack (ulimit -s) size to: 1966080 bytes or 1920 kb (calculated by: NDRX_MSGSIZEMAX(65536)*NDRX_STACK_MSG_FACTOR(30))
Process is terminating with error...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this case stack size needs to be increased, that could be done by in multiple
ways:

1. Change by $ ulimit -s 1920
To ensure that this is set each time the Enduro/X is started, it needs to be 
added to the "env" script of the application which prepares application
environment before app boot. Also system settings must be checked in
'/etc/security/limits.conf' either the limit is enough - "stack" parameter.

2. Set the user/system limit directly in '/etc/security/limits.conf'.
For other operating systems, please consult with corresponding manual for chaning
the message size and stack size.


Also regarding the buffer sizes, when 'NDRX_MSGMAX' is set bellow 64K, the buffer
size is fixed to 64K, this means that operations like network packet size when
using tpbridge, is set to 64K.

As the message size is in the same time a internal buffer size, this means that
not all space can be used by sending some data (for example CARRAY or UBF buffer).
Some overhead is added by Enduro/X, message headers, for bridge protocol format
extra data is added for TLV structure. Thus to be safe, for example if expected
data size is 64K, then message size should be set to something like 80KB.

== Enduro/X Smart Cache

Enduro/X support SOA level cache. This means that administrator can configure
system configuration, so that certain services are cached. Thus if some client
process calls some service X, and it gets valid results back, then data key is
built (specified in config) and for this key data is saved to 
Lightning Memory-Mapped Database (LMDB). Next time service is called, the cache
is checked, again, key is built, and lookup to LMDB is made. If results are found
in db, then actual service is X is not called, but instead saved buffer from
cache is returned back to caller. Cache works for tpcall() function.

Cache supports different features:

. Limited or unlimited caches are available. The unlimited cache is bound to
physical dimensions of db file (also specified in configuration). In case of
limited cache, number of logical items stored in cache can be specified. This is
set by 'limit' parameter for database configuration. In case if limit is specified
the strategy how to remove over-reached records can be specified in database
flags. The strategies supported are following: *LRU* - keep records recently
used, *FIFO* - delete records by chronological order (older records added to
cache are being deleted), *HITS* - records mostly accessed stays in cache.

. Multiple physical storage definitions, so that XATMI services can be allocated
in different or same physical storage. This can help to solve challenges between
storage space limitations and performance limitations (when multiple writes are
done in same physical storage).

. Cache is Enduro/X cluster aware. Records can be distributed and deleted across
the cluster nodes. Time based sync is supported when in the same time both nodes
adds records to non existing cache cell. On both cluster nodes will survive record
which is fresher. The older duplicate is zapped by tpcall() or by tpcached.

. Records can be grouped for example statement pages can be all linked to single
user. If transaction happens for user, then whole group can be invalidated. Thus
build cache again. Grouping can be also used for Denial Of Service (DoS)
protection. Enduro/X can be configured to limit the max number of new records in
group, after which any new non existing data element lookup in group will make
request buffer to reject with configured tperrno, user return code and buffer.

. Records in cache can be cross-invalidated. Meaning that "hooks" can be put on
certain service calls in order to invalidate - zap contents of some other
cache.

. Cache supports refresh conditions. So that in case if specific condition over
the data is true, the cached data not returned, but service invocation is performed
and re-cached (old data overwritten).


image:tpcache.png[caption="Figure 1: ", title="Enduro/X Smart Cache", alt="endurox start cache"]


=== Limitations of the cache

The LMDB is build in such way that if write transaction on the database is
open, then other writes will not be able to process it in meantime. While read
only transactions are processed, while some other process holds write transaction.
Also if process which is holding the lock is crashed (e.g. segfaul, kill, etc..),
then lock is automatically made free. Thus for example is using *hits* or *lru*
limitation caches, then this automatically means that during the tpcall() chaches
needs to be updated, thus lock is needed, and this means that all callers will
have to sync in that place - thus makes point of bottleneck.
