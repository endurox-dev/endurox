== How to configure Enduro/X

To configure Enduro/X you have to finish several steps.

. Have a separate system user for each Enduro/X instance.

. Setup System Environment (mount mq file system, configure mq params)

. Setup environment configuration

. Setup basic environment (demo)

. Startup the application

== Setup System

Enduro/X supports different back-end message transports. Following mechanisms
are available:

- EPOLL (for FreeBSD it is Kqueue) over the Posix queues. This is fastest and
most preferred transport mechanism when available. True on queue multiple
servers mechanism is supported for different services across different XATMI
server binaries (transport code "epoll" for GNU/Linux and "kqueue" for FreeBSD).

-  System V message queues, this is generally second best transport available
on Linux and Unix operating systems. One queue multiple servers mechanism is
available via Request Address option (rqaddr) for XATMI server. The limitation is that
each server running on same request address *MUST* provide all services provided
by other servers in same Request Address. This mechanism uses at-least one 
additional thread per XATMI participant for handling message send/receive time-outs.
In case if XATMI server, additional more thread is used for administrative message
handling and dispatching to main server thread. Thus compiler must support
the multi-threaded operations for user applications (transport code "SystemV").

- The third option if POLL over the Posix queues. This uses round-robin approach
for message delivery to load balanced servers. One additional thread is used
for server process to monitor queues (transport code "poll").

- The forth option is emulated message queue which uses shared memory and process
shared Posix locks to emulate the mssage queue (transport code "emq").

'R' - supported and release provided.

'X' - not supported.

Each of these IPC transports for particular operating system requires specific
approach for configuring the limits and other attributes for runtime.

Note that transport version is built into Enduro/X distribution. Thus to change
the IPC transport, different Enduro/X version must be installed (i.e. cannot
be changed by parameters). As the ABI for user apps stays the same, the user
application is not required to be rebuilt.

=== Release file format

The release file for Enduro/X encodes different information. For example
file names 

. endurox-5.4.1-1.ubuntu18_04_GNU_epoll.x86_64_64.deb 

. endurox-5.4.1-1.SUNOS5_10_GNU_SystemV.sparc_64

encodes following information:

=== Linux setup

In this chapter will be described typical GNU/Linux system configuration required
for Enduro/X. Two sets of configurations are available for Linux OS. One is for
Posix queues with epoll and another configuration is System V configuration.

Kernel parameter configuration is needed for Enduro/X runtime. But as we plan here
to build the system and run unit-tests, then we need a configuration for runtime.

==== Increase OS limits

---------------------------------------------------------------------
$ sudo -s
# cat << EOF >> /etc/security/limits.conf

# Do not limit message Q Count.
# Some Linux 3.x series kernels have a bug, that limits 1024 
# queues for one system user.
# In 2.6.x and 4.x this is fixed, to have 
# unlimited count of queues (memory limit).
# ealrier and later Linuxes have fixed this issue.
*               soft    msgqueue        -1
*               hard    msgqueue        -1

# Increase the number of open files 
*               soft    nofile  1024
*               hard    nofile  65536

EOF
# exit
$
---------------------------------------------------------------------

==== Linux system setup for running in EPOLL/Posix queue mode

This step request mounting of Posix queues and change Posix queue limits

===== Mounting Posix queues

This step does not apply to following Operating Systems - for these continue with
next chapter:

. Ubuntu 16.04 and above

. Debian 8.x and above

When running in e-poll mode Enduro/X needs access to virtual file system which
provides Posix queue management. One way would be to mount it via "/etc/fstab",
but for older system compatibility, we provide instructions that would work for
all OSes. To do this automatically at system startup, Linuxes which supports 
'/etc/rc.local', must add following lines before "exit 0".

---------------------------------------------------------------------
#!/bin/bash

# Mount the /dev/mqueue
# Not for Debian 8.x: queue is already mounted, thus test:

if [ ! -d /dev/mqueue ]; then
	mkdir /dev/mqueue
	mount -t mqueue none /dev/mqueue
fi

exit 0
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Note for Centos/RHEL/Oracle Linux 7+ you need to give execute 
permissions for rc.local:

---------------------------------------------------------------------
# chmod +x /etc/rc.local
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Load the configuration by doing:

---------------------------------------------------------------------
# /etc/rc.local
---------------------------------------------------------------------

===== Setting Posix queue limits

Next step is to configure queue limits, this is done by changing Linux kernel
parameters, in persistent way, so that new settings are applied at the OS boot.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
$ sudo -s

# cat << EOF >> /etc/sysctl.conf

# Max Messages in Queue
fs.mqueue.msg_max=10000

# Max message size, to pass unit tests, use 1M+1K
fs.mqueue.msgsize_max=1049600

# Max number of queues for user
fs.mqueue.queues_max=10000

EOF

# Apply kernel parameters now
$ sudo sysctl -f /etc/sysctl.conf

# to check the values, use (print all) and use grep to find:
$ sudo sysctl -a | grep msgsize_max
---------------------------------------------------------------------

==== Setting System V queue limits

To pass the Enduro/X unit tests, certain queue configuration is required. Use
following kernel settings:

---------------------------------------------------------------------

$ sudo -s

# cat << EOF >> /etc/sysctl.conf

# max queues system wide, 40K should be fine
kernel.msgmni=40000

# max size of message (bytes), ~1M should be fine
kernel.msgmax=1049600

# default max size of queue (bytes), ~10M should be fine
kernel.msgmnb=104960000

EOF

# persist the values
$ sudo sysctl -f /etc/sysctl.conf

# Check status...
$ sudo sysctl -a | grep msgmnb
---------------------------------------------------------------------

=== FreeBSD setup

For FreeBSD only officially supported version if Posix queues, thus this operating
system requires some settings for these IPC resources to pass the unit testing and
also settings are generally fine for average application.

==== Configuring the system
Queue file system must be mounted when OS starts. Firstly we need a folder 
'/mnt/mqueue' where the queues are mount. And secondly we will add the automatic 
mount at system startup in '/etc/fstab'.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
# mkdir /mnt/mqueue
# cat << EOF >> /etc/fstab
null    /mnt/mqueue     mqueuefs	     rw	     0	     0
EOF
# mount /mnt/mqueue
---------------------------------------------------------------------

You also need to change the queue parameters: 

---------------------------------------------------------------------
# cat << EOF >> /etc/sysctl.conf

# kernel tunables for Enduro/X:
kern.mqueue.curmq=1
kern.mqueue.maxmq=30000
kern.mqueue.maxmsgsize=64000
kern.mqueue.maxmsg=1000

EOF

# sysctl -f /etc/sysctl.conf
---------------------------------------------------------------------

For LMDB testing more semaphores shall be allowed

---------------------------------------------------------------------
# cat << EOF >> /boot/loader.conf

# kernel tunables for Enduro/X:
kern.ipc.semmns=2048
kern.ipc.semmni=500

EOF

---------------------------------------------------------------------

After changing /boot/loader.conf, reboot of system is required.

Enduro/X testing framework uses '/bin/bash' in scripting, thus we must
get it working. Also perl is assumed to to be '/usr/bin/perl'. Thus:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
# ln -s /usr/local/bin/bash /bin/bash
# ln -s /usr/local/bin/perl /usr/bin/perl
---------------------------------------------------------------------

*reboot* to apply new settings (limits & mqueue mount)

=== AIX setup

On the other hand AIX do not require any fine tuning for System V queues, because
it is doing automatic adjustments to queue limitations. However to pass the
Enduro/X standard unit tests, the security limits must be configured. Unit tests
uses standard user "user1" for this purposes. Thus here stack, data mem size,
file size and rss sizes are set to unlimited. For example if stack/data/rss is
not set correctly, some multi-threaded components of Enduro/X might hang during
the startup, for example *tpbridge(8)*.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
cat << EOF >> /etc/security/limits

user1:
        stack = 655360
        data = -1
        rss = -1
        fsize = -1
EOF
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

=== Solaris setup

To pass the Enduro/X unit tests on Solaris, System V queue settings must be applied.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
# cat << EOF >> /etc/system
set msgsys:msginfo_msgmni = 10000
set msgsys:msginfo_msgmnb = 10496000

EOF
---------------------------------------------------------------------

So here 'msgmni' is maximum number of queues that can be created and 'msgmnb'
is single queue maximum size which here is 10MB.

After changing the settings, reboot the server.


=== MacOS setup

OSX does not use require any kernel parameter changes, as emulated message queue
is used here. Only it required that sufficient disk space is available to '/tmp'
directory, as the memory mapped queue files will be stored there. 

As Enduro/X uses System V shared memory segments, the default sizes are not
sufficient for the at least Enduro/X unit testing. Thus limits needs to be
changed:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ sudo -s
# cat << EOF >> /boot/loader.conf
kern.sysv.shmmax=419430400
kern.sysv.shmmin=1
kern.sysv.shmmni=32
kern.sysv.shmseg=8
kern.sysv.shmall=102400
kern.maxfiles=524288
kern.maxfilesperproc=262144

EOF
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After this reboot is required.

== Setup environment configuration

Enduro/X depends lot of Environment variables. See manpage of 'ex_env' (<<EX_ENV>>)
to see all parameters that must be setup. There is also sample configuration
provided. Normally it is expected that separate shell script file is setup containing
all parameters. Then to load the environment, login with Enduro/X user in, and run
following command in your app dir, for example:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ cd /endurox/app/conf
$ . setapp
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

== Setting up Enduro/X demonstration environment

This section describes how to create a basic Enduro/X environment. Document will
also explain the resources used by Enduro/X from the system setup and
administrative perspective. Section will also explain the contents for each of
the generated file, so that runtime can be manually reconstructed, which is
usable for AIX operating system, as there "xadmin provision" command is not 
available.

=== Creating default runtime and starting it up

To create generic runtime with Enduro/X "stock" servers processes, use following
command:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ xadmin provision  -d
To control debug output, set debugconfig file path in $NDRX_DEBUG_CONF

To start your system, run following commands:
$ cd /tmp/demo/conf
$ source settest1
$ xadmin start -y


Provision succeed!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

During the provision following directory structure was created at project root
which is "/tmp/demo", where following data is intended to be stored:

.Enduro/X distribution file name naming conventions
[width="40%",options="header"]
|=========================================================
|Directory|File stored
|ubftab|UBF field tables
|tmlogs/rm1|transaction manager logs, sub-folder for resource manager 1
|conf|configuration files
|bin|program binaries (executables)
|qdata|persistent queue data
|tmp|temporary files like pid file, etc.
|log|Enduro/X and user log files
|=========================================================

If demo needs to be started on AIX os, then these folders needs to be created by
hand.

Most interesting thing at the given step is configuration files. The provision
generates following list of files in "conf" folder:

.Enduro/X typical application configuration files
[width="40%", options="header"]
|=========================================================
|Directory|File stored
|app.ini|Application configuration
|ndrxconfig.xml|Application server process configuration
|settest1|Bash script for setting the Enduro/X environment
|=========================================================

Next chapters describe contents for each of the configuration files

==== Configuration file: "app.ini" for Common-Configuration (CC) mode 

This file contains global settings (which alternatively can be set as environment
variables, see ex_env(5)) in section *[@global]*. *app.ini* also contains debug 
configuration in section *[@debug]* (which alternatively can be configured in
separated file, see ndrxdebug.conf(5)). The ini file is also used by other 
Enduro/X services like persistent queues, defined in *[@queue]*. The ini files
allows sections to inherit settings from parents sections. The sub-sections
can be configuration at process level with *NDRX_CCTAG* env variable, or this
can be done in *ndrxconfig.xml* at *<cctag />* XML tag for XATMI servers and
*cctag* attribute for CPMSRV clients.

The demo *app.ini* section looks like:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[@queue]
; Default manual queue (reserved name '@'), unknown queues are created based on this template:

[@queue/RM1TMQ]
; Sample queue (this one is automatic, sends messages to target service)
TESTQ1=svcnm=TESTSVC1,autoq=y,tries=3,waitinit=1,waitretry=1,waitretryinc=2,waitretrymax=5,memonly=n,mode=fifo
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The above also describes the configuration for Resource Manager 1 - which is used
by persistent message queue. The Resource manager settings applies at global
level and one process may only work with one RM, thus processes operating with
particular Resource Manager, shall use CCTAG "RM1TMQ".

==== Configuration file: "ndrxconfig.xml" for demo process descriptions

The demo system does not include any user processes, but almost all Enduro/X
distributed special services are configuration. The configuration of system
processes looks almost the same as for user processes, thus this gives some 
insight on how to configure the system.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The above configuration includes the maximum settings which are by default on
from the provision script. This includes configuration servers (*cconfsrv(8)*) -
which allows to download the configuration from ini files by standard *tpcall(3)*
command. Then it also includes event server, persistent queue and transaction
manager for persistent queue. Bridge connection, configured as active (client)
side is added and client process monitor (*cpmsrv(8)*) is started with server id 9999. 
Thus once *cpmsrv* is booted, it will start the processes from "<clients/>" tag.


== Cluster configuration

To setup cluster see you have to setup bridge ATMI processes on each of the machines.
See <<TPBRIDGE>> documentation to have understanding of clustering. Sample setup of
cluster node which actively connects to Node 2 and waits call from Node 12 could
look like:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<endurox>
	<appconfig>
		<sanity>10</sanity>
		<brrefresh>6</brrefresh>
		<restart_min>1</restart_min>
		<restart_step>1</restart_step>
		<restart_max>5</restart_max>
		<restart_to_check>20</restart_to_check>
	</appconfig>
	<defaults>
		<min>1</min>
		<max>2</max>
		<autokill>1</autokill>
		<respawn>1<respawn>
		<start_max>2</start_max>
		<pingtime>1</pingtime>
		<ping_max>4</ping_max>
		<end_max>3</end_max>
		<killtime>1</killtime>
	</defaults>
	<servers>
		<!-- Connect to cluster node 2, we will wait for call -->
		<server name="tpbridge">
			<max>1</max>
			<srvid>101</srvid>
			<sysopt>-e /tmp/BRIDGE002 -r</sysopt>
			<appopt>-n2 -r -i 0.0.0.0 -p 4433 -tP -z30</appopt>
		</server>
		<!-- Connect to cluster node 12, we try to connect activetly to it -->
		<server name="tpbridge">
			<max>1</max>
			<srvid>102</srvid>
			<sysopt>-e /tmp/BRIDGE012 -r</sysopt>
			<appopt>-n12 -r -i 195.122.24.13 -p 14433 -tA -z30</appopt>
		</server>
	</servers>
</endurox>

=== Starting the demo application server instance

The startup is straight forward. The environment variables needs to be loaded
either by *source* command or by dot (.) notation.

The application instance is started!

== Max message size and internal buffer sizes

Starting from Enduro/X version 5.1+, the max message size what can be transported
over the XATMI sub-system is limited to the operating system's queue settings.
For example on Linux kernel 3.13 the message size limit (/proc/sys/fs/mqueue/msgsize_max)
is around 10 MB. The message size is configured with 'NDRX_MSGMAX' environment
variable, see ex_env(5) man page.

Also what should be noted, as Enduro/X mostly uses stack allocation
instead of heap allocation (for safer and faster code), then there are requirements
against the stack size. The stack size (ulimit -s) must be at least size of message
multiplied with 30. So for example if message size is set to 1 MegaByte, then stack
size shall be set to 30 Mega bytes (ulimit -s 30720 KB). If the stack is not sufficient
the following error will be print when attempting to run any Enduro/X based software:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Logging to ./ULOG.20171112
Failed to open [./ULOG.20171112]
 9138:20171112:19144166:xadmin      :LIMITS ERROR ! Please set stack (ulimit -s) size to: 1966080 bytes or 1920 kb (calculated by: NDRX_MSGSIZEMAX(65536)*NDRX_STACK_MSG_FACTOR(30))

LIMITS ERROR ! Please set stack (ulimit -s) size to: 1966080 bytes or 1920 kb (calculated by: NDRX_MSGSIZEMAX(65536)*NDRX_STACK_MSG_FACTOR(30))
Process is terminating with error...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this case stack size needs to be increased, that could be done by in multiple
ways:

1. Change by $ ulimit -s 1920
To ensure that this is set each time the Enduro/X is started, it needs to be 
added to the "env" script of the application which prepares application
environment before app boot. Also system settings must be checked in
'/etc/security/limits.conf' either the limit is enough - "stack" parameter.

2. Set the user/system limit directly in '/etc/security/limits.conf'.
For other operating systems, please consult with corresponding manual for changing
the message size and stack size.

Also regarding the buffer sizes, when 'NDRX_MSGMAX' is set bellow 64K, the buffer
size is fixed to 64K, this means that operations like network packet size when
using tpbridge, is set to 64K.

As the message size is in the same time a internal buffer size, this means that
not all space can be used by sending some data (for example CARRAY or UBF buffer).
Some overhead is added by Enduro/X, message headers, for bridge protocol format
extra data is added for TLV structure. Thus to be safe, for example if expected
data size is 64K, then message size should be set to something like 80KB.


For threads which are spawned by Enduro/X for bridge, transaction manager and
other processes, the Pthreads stack size is automatically adjusted. By default
new thread does not use parent's thread stack size, but instead some default
value is used. Which usually is quite small. Thus to get rid with this problem
Enduro/X detects current process stack limit and tries to set this in thread
attributes. To get current stack size, the getrlimit (RLIMIT_STACK, ...) system
call is used. How ever with IBM AIX 7.1 SP 2 TL 5, it is been seen that 
pthread_attr_setstacksize() fails for read stack size, with error *EINVAL*. Thus
this give some uncertainty what stack size to use. Thus to fix the problem,
the code tries in loop the use the size attribute, each time with failure new
stack size is two times lower than previous. This is done until the correct
value is found. If value is not found (i.e. target size is 0 after divisions),
the user message is logged:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Error ! failed to set stack value!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Process continues after this, but it can be expected that random errors or
core dumps may appear.


== Enduro/X Smart Cache

Enduro/X support SOA level cache. This means that administrator can configure
system configuration, so that certain services are cached. Thus if some client
process calls some service X, and it gets valid results back, then data key is
built (specified in config) and for this key data is saved to 
Lightning Memory-Mapped Database (LMDB). Next time service is called, the cache
is checked, again, key is built, and lookup to LMDB is made. If results are found
in db, then actual service is X is not called, but instead saved buffer from
cache is returned back to caller. Cache works for tpcall() function.

Cache supports different features:

. Limited or unlimited caches are available. The unlimited cache is bound to
physical dimensions of db file (also specified in configuration). In case of
limited cache, number of logical items stored in cache can be specified. This is
set by 'limit' parameter for database configuration. In case if limit is specified
the strategy how to remove over-reached records can be specified in database
flags. The strategies supported are following: *LRU* - keep records recently
used, *FIFO* - delete records by chronological order (older records added to
cache are being deleted), *HITS* - records mostly accessed stays in cache.

. Multiple physical storage definitions, so that XATMI services can be allocated
in different or same physical storage. This can help to solve challenges between
storage space limitations and performance limitations (when multiple writes are
done in same physical storage).

. Cache is Enduro/X cluster aware. Records can be distributed and deleted across
the cluster nodes. Time based sync is supported when in the same time both nodes
adds records to non existing cache cell. On both cluster nodes will survive record
which is fresher. The older duplicate is zapped by tpcall() or by tpcached.

. Records can be grouped for example statement pages can be all linked to single
user. If transaction happens for user, then whole group can be invalidated. Thus
build cache again. Grouping can be also used for Denial Of Service (DoS)
protection. Enduro/X can be configured to limit the max number of new records in
group, after which any new non existing data element lookup in group will make
request buffer to reject with configured tperrno, user return code and buffer.

. Records in cache can be cross-invalidated. Meaning that "hooks" can be put on
certain service calls in order to invalidate - zap contents of some other
cache.

. Cache supports refresh conditions. So that in case if specific condition over
the data is true, the cached data not returned, but service invocation is performed
and re-cached (old data overwritten).

=== Limitations of the cache

The LMDB is build in such way that if write transaction on the database is
open, then other writes will not be able to process it in meantime. While read
only transactions are processed, while some other process holds write transaction.
Also if process which is holding the lock is crashed (e.g. segfaul, kill, etc..),
then lock is automatically made free. Thus for example is using *hits* or *lru*
limitation caches, then this automatically means that during the tpcall() caches
needs to be updated, thus lock is needed, and this means that all callers will
have to sync in that place - thus makes point of bottleneck.


== Enduro/X Monitoring with NetXMS

NetXMS monitoring tool has the agent plugin for Enduro/X. This section will
describe the basic elements how to monitor Enduro/X with help of this tool

Enduro/X exposes following list of the tables which can monitor:

- *Endurox.Clients* - information about client processes.

- *Endurox.Machines* - information about cluster machines.

- *Endurox.Queues* - information about local queues.

- *Endurox.ServerInstances* - information about XATMI server processes.

- *Endurox.ServiceGroups* - dynamic information about XATMI services.

- *Endurox.Services* - static information about XATMI services.

To start the Enduro/X monitoring with the NetXMS, firstly the agent must be compiled
with Enduro/X support. Thus the system has to have compiler installed and access
to Internet must be (for fetching the sources from the github).

=== Building the Agent

To build the agent, system must have C/C++ compiler installed and "git" tool too.
Basically if Enduro/X build dependencies are met on the host, then Netxms agent
will build too. For more details consult with the project specific documentation.

But in general, to build the agent for Enduro/X, do the following steps:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

$ git clone https://github.com/netxms/netxms
$ cd netxms
$ ./reconf
$ ./configure --with-agent --prefix=/path/to/install --with-tuxedo=/usr --disable-mqtt
$ make
$ sudo make install
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If doing basic setup, then usually you need to setup the configuration file for
agent to allow the incoming servers connections, for example:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# cat << EOF > /etc/nxagentd.conf

LogFile=/var/log/nxagentd

# IP white list, can contain multiple records separated by comma.
# CIDR notation supported for subnets.
MasterServers=127.0.0.0/8,172.17.0.1,192.168.43.98
ServerConnection=192.168.43.98
SubAgent=tuxedo.nsm

EOF

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once configuration is done, the *nxagentd* shall be started from Enduro/X
environment, so that agent will be able to call *tpadmsv(8)* services. Usually
agent is started from *cpmsrv(8)*.

To start the agent manually, following commands may be used:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ cd /path/to/install/bin

-- have some debug in current session:
$ ./nxagentd -D5

-- or to start as deamon:
$ ./nxagentd -D5


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In case of CPMSRV, following can be used as configuration:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
...
        <!-- Client section -->
        <clients>
...
                <client cmdline="/path/to/install/bin/nxagentd -D5 -c/etc/nxagentd.conf" log="/tmp/nxagentd.log">
                        <exec tag="NXAGENT" autostart="Y" />
                </client>
...
        </clients>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


=== Checking the available parameters from server

To check the list parameters that can be monitored, use following command:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

$ nxget -l <agent ip addr>  Agent.SupportedParameters 


...
Endurox.Client.ActiveConversations(*)
Endurox.Client.ActiveRequests(*)
Endurox.Client.Machine(*)
Endurox.Client.Name(*)
Endurox.Client.State(*)
Endurox.Domain.ID
Endurox.Domain.Queues
Endurox.Domain.Servers
Endurox.Domain.Services
Endurox.Domain.State
Endurox.Machine.Accessers(*)
Endurox.Machine.Clients(*)
Endurox.Machine.Conversations(*)
Endurox.Machine.State(*)
Endurox.Queue.Machine(*)
Endurox.Queue.RequestsCurrent(*)
Endurox.Queue.State(*)
Endurox.ServerInstance.CommandLine(*)
Endurox.ServerInstance.Generation(*)
Endurox.ServerInstance.Machine(*)
Endurox.ServerInstance.Name(*)
Endurox.ServerInstance.PID(*)
Endurox.ServerInstance.State(*)
Endurox.Service.State(*)
Endurox.ServiceGroup.CompletedRequests(*)
Endurox.ServiceGroup.FailedRequests(*)
Endurox.ServiceGroup.LastExecutionTime(*)
Endurox.ServiceGroup.MaxExecutionTime(*)
Endurox.ServiceGroup.MinExecutionTime(*)
Endurox.ServiceGroup.State(*)
Endurox.ServiceGroup.SuccessfulRequests(*)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


To return the values from particular table, use following command:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

$ nxget -T <agent ip> <table name e.g. Endurox.Clients>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

==== Monitoring list of the items

In NetXMS it is possible import and monitor list of the resources. That can be
done in the following way:

Firstly in Configure Data Collection Items (DCI) for new item. For example:

image:netxms_new_dci.png[caption="Figure 2: ", title="New DCI", alt="New DIC"]

*NOTE*: As Enduro/X uses comma in identifiers, then in templates quotes must be
used surrounding "'{instance}'" placeholder. For following classes quotes are needed:

- Endurox.Queue

- Endurox.Clients


Next configure agent list from which to discover the items:

image:netxms_new_dci2.png[caption="Figure 3: ", title="Agent list", alt="Agent list"]

Once this is configured, instances shall be discovered. On monitored node in NetXMS
Console, press *left mouse button > Poll > Instance discovery*


After running the instance discovery, following output may be received:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
