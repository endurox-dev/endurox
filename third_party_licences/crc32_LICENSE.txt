CRC-32 version 2.0.0 by Craig Bruce, 2006-04-29.

This program generates the CRC-32 values for the files named in the
command-line arguments.  These are the same CRC-32 values used by GZIP,
PKZIP, and ZMODEM.  The Crc32_ComputeBuf() can also be detached and
used independently.

THIS PROGRAM IS PUBLIC-DOMAIN SOFTWARE.

Based on the byte-oriented implementation "File Verification Using CRC"
by Mark R. Nelson in Dr. Dobb's Journal, May 1992, pp. 64-67.
